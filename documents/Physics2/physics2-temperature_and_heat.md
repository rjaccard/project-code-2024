# CHAPTER 1 <br> Temperature and Heat 

INTRODUCTION Heat and temperature are important concepts for each of us, every day. How we dress in the morning depends on whether the day is hot or cold, and most of what we do requires energy that ultimately comes from the Sun. The study of heat and temperature is part of an area of physics known as thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the flow of energy throughout the universe. They are studied in all areas of science and engineering, from chemistry to biology to environmental science.

In this chapter, we explore heat and temperature. It is not always easy to distinguish these terms. Heat is the flow of energy from one object to another. This flow of energy is caused by a difference in temperature. The
transfer of heat can change temperature, as can work, another kind of energy transfer that is central to thermodynamics. We return to these basic ideas several times throughout the next four chapters, and you will see that they affect everything from the behavior of atoms and molecules to cooking to our weather on Earth to the life cycles of stars.

### 1.1 Temperature and Thermal Equilibrium

Heat is familiar to all of us. We can feel heat entering our bodies from the summer Sun or from hot coffee or tea after a winter stroll. We can also feel heat leaving our bodies as we feel the chill of night or the cooling effect of sweat after exercise.

What is heat? How do we define it and how is it related to temperature? What are the effects of heat and how does it flow from place to place? We will find that, in spite of the richness of the phenomena, a small set of underlying physical principles unites these subjects and ties them to other fields. We start by examining temperature and how to define and measure it.

## Temperature

The concept of temperature has evolved from the common concepts of hot and cold. The scientific definition of temperature explains more than our senses of hot and cold. As you may have already learned, many physical quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are observed or measured, that is, they are defined operationally. Temperature is operationally defined as the quantity of what we measure with a thermometer. As we will see in detail in a later chapter on the kinetic theory of gases, temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of translation, a fact that provides a more physical definition. Differences in temperature maintain the transfer of heat, or heat transfer, throughout the universe. Heat transfer is the movement of energy from one place or material to another as a result of a difference in temperature. (You will learn more about heat transfer later in this chapter.)

## Thermal Equilibrium

An important concept related to temperature is thermal equilibrium. Two objects are in thermal equilibrium if they are in close contact that allows either to gain energy from the other, but nevertheless, no net energy is transferred between them. Even when not in contact, they are in thermal equilibrium if, when they are placed in contact, no net energy is transferred between them. If two objects remain in contact for a long time, they typically come to equilibrium. In other words, two objects in thermal equilibrium do not exchange energy.

Experimentally, if object $A$ is in equilibrium with object $B$, and object $B$ is in equilibrium with object $C$, then (as you may have already guessed) object $A$ is in equilibrium with object $C$. That statement of transitivity is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics. (The number "zeroth" was suggested by British physicist Ralph Fowler in the 1930s. The first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics were already named and numbered then. The zeroth law had seldom been stated, but it needs to be discussed before the others, so Fowler gave it a smaller number.) Consider the case where $A$ is a thermometer. The zeroth law tells us that if $A$ reads a certain temperature when in equilibrium with $B$, and it is then placed in contact with $C$, it will not exchange energy with $C$; therefore, its temperature reading will remain the same (Figure 1.2). In other words, if two objects are in thermal equilibrium, they have the same temperature.

A thermometer measures its own temperature. It is through the concepts of thermal equilibrium and the zeroth law of thermodynamics that we can say that a thermometer measures the temperature of something else, and to make sense of the statement that two objects are at the same temperature.

In the rest of this chapter, we will often refer to "systems" instead of "objects." As in the chapter on linear momentum and collisions, a system consists of one or more objects-but in thermodynamics, we require a system to be macroscopic, that is, to consist of a huge number (such as $10^{23}$ ) of molecules. Then we can say that a system is in thermal equilibrium with itself if all parts of it are at the same temperature. (We will return to the definition of a thermodynamic system in the chapter on the first law of thermodynamics.)

### 1.2 Thermometers and Temperature Scales

Any physical property that depends consistently and reproducibly on temperature can be used as the basis of a thermometer. For example, volume increases with temperature for most substances. This property is the basis for the common alcohol thermometer and the original mercury thermometers. Other properties used to measure temperature include electrical resistance, color, and the emission of infrared radiation (Figure 1.3).

Thermometers measure temperature according to well-defined scales of measurement. The three most common temperature scales are Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. Temperature scales are created by identifying two reproducible temperatures. The freezing and boiling temperatures of water at standard atmospheric pressure are commonly used.

On the Celsius scale, the freezing point of water is $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the boiling point is $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The unit of temperature on this scale is the degree Celsius $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ ). The Fahrenheit scale (still the most frequently used for common purposes in the United States) has the freezing point of water at $32^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and the boiling point at $212^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Its unit is the degree Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. You can see that 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees. Thus, a temperature difference of one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times as large as a difference of one degree on the Fahrenheit scale, or $\Delta T_{\mathrm{F}}=\frac{9}{5} \Delta T_{\mathrm{C}}$.

The definition of temperature in terms of molecular motion suggests that there should be a lowest possible temperature, where the average kinetic energy of molecules is zero (or the minimum allowed by quantum mechanics). Experiments confirm the existence of such a temperature, called absolute zero. An absolute temperature scale is one whose zero point is absolute zero. Such scales are convenient in science because several physical quantities, such as the volume of an ideal gas, are directly related to absolute temperature.

The Kelvin scale is the absolute temperature scale that is commonly used in science. The SI temperature unit is the kelvin, which is abbreviated $\mathrm{K}$ (not accompanied by a degree sign). Thus $0 \mathrm{~K}$ is absolute zero. The freezing and boiling points of water are $273.15 \mathrm{~K}$ and $373.15 \mathrm{~K}$, respectively. Therefore, temperature differences are the same in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius, or $\Delta T_{C}=\Delta T_{K}$.

The relationships between the three common temperature scales are shown in Figure 1.4. Temperatures on these scales can be converted using the equations in Table 1.1.

| To convert from... | Use this equation... |
| :--- | :--- |
| Celsius to Fahrenheit | $T_{\mathrm{F}}=\frac{9}{5} T_{\mathrm{C}}+32$ |
| Fahrenheit to Celsius | $T_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{5}{9}\left(T_{\mathrm{F}}-32\right)$ |
| Celsius to Kelvin | $T_{\mathrm{K}}=T_{\mathrm{C}}+273.15$ |
| Kelvin to Celsius | $T_{\mathrm{C}}=T_{\mathrm{K}}-273.15$ |
| Fahrenheit to Kelvin | $T_{\mathrm{K}}=\frac{5}{9}\left(T_{\mathrm{F}}-32\right)+273.15$ |
| Kelvin to Fahrenheit | $T_{\mathrm{F}}=\frac{9}{5}\left(T_{\mathrm{K}}-273.15\right)+32$ |

Table 1.1 Temperature Conversions

To convert between Fahrenheit and Kelvin, convert to Celsius as an intermediate step.

EXAMPLE 1.1

## Converting between Temperature Scales: Room Temperature

"Room temperature" is generally defined in physics to be $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. (a) What is room temperature in ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ? (b) What is it in $K$ ?

## Strategy

To answer these questions, all we need to do is choose the correct conversion equations and substitute the known values.

## Solution

To convert from ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, use the equation

$$
T_{\mathrm{F}}=\frac{9}{5} T_{\mathrm{C}}+32
$$

Substitute the known value into the equation and solve:

$$
T_{\mathrm{F}}=\frac{9}{5}\left(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+32=77^{\circ} \mathrm{F}
$$

Similarly, we find that $T_{\mathrm{K}}=T_{\mathrm{C}}+273.15=298 \mathrm{~K}$.

The Kelvin scale is part of the SI system of units, so its actual definition is more complicated than the one given above. First, it is not defined in terms of the freezing and boiling points of water, but in terms of the triple point. The triple point is the unique combination of temperature and pressure at which ice, liquid water, and water vapor can coexist stably. As will be discussed in the section on phase changes, the coexistence is achieved by lowering the pressure and consequently the boiling point to reach the freezing point. The triplepoint temperature is defined as $273.16 \mathrm{~K}$. This definition has the advantage that although the freezing temperature and boiling temperature of water depend on pressure, there is only one triple-point temperature.

Second, even with two points on the scale defined, different thermometers give somewhat different results for other temperatures. Therefore, a standard thermometer is required. Metrologists (experts in the science of measurement) have chosen the constant-volume gas thermometer for this purpose. A vessel of constant volume filled with gas is subjected to temperature changes, and the measured temperature is proportional to the change in pressure. Using "TP" to represent the triple point,

$$
T=\frac{p}{p_{\mathrm{TP}}} \boldsymbol{T}_{\mathrm{TP}}
$$

The results depend somewhat on the choice of gas, but the less dense the gas in the bulb, the better the results for different gases agree. If the results are extrapolated to zero density, the results agree quite well, with zero pressure corresponding to a temperature of absolute zero.

Constant-volume gas thermometers are big and come to equilibrium slowly, so they are used mostly as standards to calibrate other thermometers.

### 1.3 Thermal Expansion

The expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered examples of thermal expansion, which is the change in size or volume of a given system as its temperature changes. The most visible example is the expansion of hot air. When air is heated, it expands and becomes less dense than the surrounding air, which then exerts an (upward) force on the hot air and makes steam and smoke rise, hot air balloons float, and so forth. The same behavior happens in all liquids and gases, driving natural heat transfer upward in homes, oceans, and weather systems, as we will discuss in an upcoming section. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and bridges, for example, have expansion joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes, as shown in Figure 1.5.

What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? As previously mentioned, an increase in temperature means an increase in the kinetic energy of individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the molecules are held in place by forces from neighboring molecules; as we saw in Oscillations, the forces can be modeled as in harmonic springs described by the Lennard-Jones potential. Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion shows that such potentials are asymmetrical in that the potential energy increases more steeply when the molecules get closer to each other than when they get farther away. Thus, at a given kinetic energy, the distance moved is greater when neighbors move away from each other than when they move toward each other. The result is that increased kinetic energy (increased temperature) increases the average distance between molecules-the substance expands.

For most substances under ordinary conditions, it is an excellent approximation that there is no preferred direction (that is, the solid is "isotropic"), and an increase in temperature increases the solid's size by a certain fraction in each dimension. Therefore, if the solid is free to expand or contract, its proportions stay the same; only its overall size changes.

## Linear Thermal Expansion

According to experiments, the dependence of thermal expansion on temperature, substance, and original initial length is summarized in the equation

$$
\frac{d L}{d T}=\alpha L
$$

where $\frac{d L}{d T}$ is the instantaneous change in length per temperature, $L$ is the length, and $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion, a material property that varies slightly with temperature. As $\alpha$ is nearly constant and also very small, for practical purposes, we use the linear approximation:

$$
\Delta L=\alpha L \Delta T
$$

where $\Delta L$ is the change in length and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

Table 1.2 lists representative values of the coefficient of linear expansion. As noted earlier, $\Delta \boldsymbol{T}$ is the same whether it is expressed in units of degrees Celsius or kelvins; thus, $\alpha$ may have units of $1 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or $1 / \mathrm{K}$ with the same value in either case. Approximating $\alpha$ as a constant is quite accurate for small changes in temperature
and sufficient for most practical purposes, even for large changes in temperature. We examine this approximation more closely in the next example.

Table 1.2 Thermal Expansion Coefficients

Thermal expansion is exploited in the bimetallic strip (Figure 1.6). This device can be used as a thermometer if the curving strip is attached to a pointer on a scale. It can also be used to automatically close or open a switch at a certain temperature, as in older or analog thermostats.

## EXAMPLE 1.2

## Calculating Linear Thermal Expansion

The main span of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge is $1275 \mathrm{~m}$ long at its coldest. The bridge is exposed to temperatures ranging from $-15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is its change in length between these temperatures? Assume that the bridge is made entirely of steel.

## Strategy

Use the equation for linear thermal expansion $\Delta L=\alpha L \Delta T$ to calculate the change in length, $\Delta L$. Use the coefficient of linear expansion $\alpha$ for steel from Table 1.2, and note that the change in temperature $\Delta T$ is $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

## Solution

Substitute all of the known values into the equation to solve for $\Delta L$ :

$$
\Delta L=\alpha L \Delta T=\left(\frac{12 \times 10^{-6}}{{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}\right)(1275 \mathrm{~m})\left(55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=0.84 \mathrm{~m}
$$

## Significance

Although not large compared with the length of the bridge, this change in length is observable. It is generally spread over many expansion joints so that the expansion at each joint is small.

## Thermal Expansion in Two and Three Dimensions

Unconstrained objects expand in all dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 1.7. That is, their areas and volumes, as well as their lengths, increase with temperature. Because the proportions stay the same, holes and
container volumes also get larger with temperature. If you cut a hole in a metal plate, the remaining material will expand exactly as it would if the piece you removed were still in place. The piece would get bigger, so the hole must get bigger too.

## Thermal Expansion in Two Dimensions

For small temperature changes, the change in area $\Delta A$ is given by

$$
\Delta A=2 \alpha A \Delta T
$$

where $\Delta A$ is the change in area $A, \Delta T$ is the change in temperature, and $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature. (The derivation of this equation is analogous to that of the more important equation for three dimensions, below.)

## Thermal Expansion in Three Dimensions

The relationship between volume and temperature $\frac{d V}{d T}$ is given by $\frac{d V}{d T}=\beta V$, where $\beta$ is the coefficient of volume expansion. As you can show in Exercise $1.60, \beta=3 \alpha$. This equation is usually written as

$$
\Delta V=\beta V \Delta T
$$

Note that the values of $\beta$ in Table 1.2 are equal to $3 \alpha$ except for rounding.

Volume expansion is defined for liquids, but linear and area expansion are not, as a liquid's changes in linear dimensions and area depend on the shape of its container. Thus, Table 1.2 shows liquids' values of $\beta$ but not $\alpha$.

In general, objects expand with increasing temperature. Water is the most important exception to this rule. Water does expand with increasing temperature (its density decreases) at temperatures greater than $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. However, it is densest at $+4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and expands with decreasing temperature between $+4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right.$ to $\left.32^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, as shown in Figure 1.8. A striking effect of this phenomenon is the freezing of water in a pond. When water near the surface cools down to $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, it is denser than the remaining water and thus sinks to the bottom. This "turnover" leaves a layer of warmer water near the surface, which is then cooled. However, if the temperature in the surface layer drops below $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, that water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays near the top. As a result, the pond surface can freeze over. The layer of ice insulates the liquid water below it from low air temperatures. Fish and other aquatic life can survive in $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of water.

## EXAMPLE 1.3

## Calculating Thermal Expansion

Suppose your 60.0-L (15.9 -gal-gal) steel gasoline tank is full of gas that is cool because it has just been pumped from an underground reservoir. Now, both the tank and the gasoline have a temperature of $15.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. How much gasoline has spilled by the time they warm to $35.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ?

## Strategy

The tank and gasoline increase in volume, but the gasoline increases more, so the amount spilled is the difference in their volume changes. We can use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the change in volume of the gasoline and of the tank. (The gasoline tank can be treated as solid steel.)

## Solution

1. Use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the increase in volume of the steel tank:

$$
\Delta V_{\mathrm{s}}=\beta_{\mathrm{s}} V_{\mathrm{s}} \Delta T
$$

2. The increase in volume of the gasoline is given by this equation:

$$
\Delta V_{\mathrm{gas}}=\beta_{\mathrm{gas}} V_{\mathrm{gas}} \Delta T
$$

3. Find the difference in volume to determine the amount spilled as

$$
V_{\text {spill }}=\Delta V_{\text {gas }}-\Delta V_{\mathrm{s}}
$$

Alternatively, we can combine these three equations into a single equation. (Note that the original volumes are equal.)

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{\text {spill }} & =\left(\beta_{\text {gas }}-\beta_{\mathrm{s}}\right) V \Delta T \\
& =\left[(950-35) \times 10^{-6} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right](60.0 \mathrm{~L})\left(20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \\
& =1.10 \mathrm{~L}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

This amount is significant, particularly for a 60.0-L tank. The effect is so striking because the gasoline and steel expand quickly. The rate of change in thermal properties is discussed later in this chapter.

If you try to cap the tank tightly to prevent overflow, you will find that it leaks anyway, either around the cap or by bursting the tank. Tightly constricting the expanding gas is equivalent to compressing it, and both liquids and solids resist compression with extremely large forces. To avoid rupturing rigid containers, these containers have air gaps, which allow them to expand and contract without stressing them.

## Thermal Stress

If you change the temperature of an object while preventing it from expanding or contracting, the object is subjected to stress that is compressive if the object would expand in the absence of constraint and tensile if it would contract. This stress resulting from temperature changes is known as thermal stress. It can be quite large and can cause damage.

To avoid this stress, engineers may design components so they can expand and contract freely. For instance, in highways, gaps are deliberately left between blocks to prevent thermal stress from developing. When no gaps can be left, engineers must consider thermal stress in their designs. Thus, the reinforcing rods in concrete are made of steel because steel's coefficient of linear expansion is nearly equal to that of concrete.

To calculate the thermal stress in a rod whose ends are both fixed rigidly, we can think of the stress as developing in two steps. First, let the ends be free to expand (or contract) and find the expansion (or contraction). Second, find the stress necessary to compress (or extend) the rod to its original length by the methods you studied in Static Equilibrium and Elasticity on static equilibrium and elasticity. In other words, the $\Delta L$ of the thermal expansion equals the $\Delta L$ of the elastic distortion (except that the signs are opposite).

## EXAMPLE 1.4

## Calculating Thermal Stress

Concrete blocks are laid out next to each other on a highway without any space between them, so they cannot expand. The construction crew did the work on a winter day when the temperature was $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find the stress in the blocks on a hot summer day when the temperature is $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The compressive Young's modulus of concrete is $Y=20 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.

## Strategy

According to the chapter on static equilibrium and elasticity, the stress $F / A$ is given by

$$
\frac{F}{A}=Y \frac{\Delta L}{L_{0}}
$$

where $Y$ is the Young's modulus of the material-concrete, in this case. In thermal expansion, $\Delta L=\alpha L_{0} \Delta T$. We combine these two equations by noting that the two $\Delta L$ 's are equal, as stated above. Because we are not given $L_{0}$ or $A$, we can obtain a numerical answer only if they both cancel out.

## Solution

We substitute the thermal-expansion equation into the elasticity equation to get

$$
\frac{F}{A}=Y \frac{\alpha L_{0} \Delta T}{L_{0}}=Y \alpha \Delta T
$$

and as we hoped, $L_{0}$ has canceled and $A$ appears only in $F / A$, the notation for the quantity we are calculating. Now we need only insert the numbers:

$$
\frac{F}{A}=\left(20 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)\left(12 \times 10^{-6} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=7.9 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}
$$

## Significance

The ultimate compressive strength of concrete is $20 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, so the blocks are unlikely to break. However, the ultimate shear strength of concrete is only $2 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, so some might chip off.

### 1.4 Heat Transfer, Specific Heat, and Calorimetry

We have seen in previous chapters that energy is one of the fundamental concepts of physics. Heat is a type of energy transfer that is caused by a temperature difference, and it can change the temperature of an object. As we learned earlier in this chapter, heat transfer is the movement of energy from one place or material to another as a result of a difference in temperature. Heat transfer is fundamental to such everyday activities as home heating and cooking, as well as many industrial processes. It also forms a basis for the topics in the remainder of this chapter.

We also introduce the concept of internal energy, which can be increased or decreased by heat transfer. We discuss another way to change the internal energy of a system, namely doing work on it. Thus, we are beginning the study of the relationship of heat and work, which is the basis of engines and refrigerators and the central topic (and origin of the name) of thermodynamics.

## Internal Energy and Heat

A thermal system has internal energy (also called thermal energy), which is the sum of the mechanical energies of its molecules. A system's internal energy is proportional to its temperature. As we saw earlier in this chapter, if two objects at different temperatures are brought into contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter to the colder object until the bodies reach thermal equilibrium (that is, they are at the same temperature). No work is done by either object because no force acts through a distance (as we discussed in Work and Kinetic Energy). These observations reveal that heat is energy transferred spontaneously due to a temperature difference. Figure 1.9 shows an example of heat transfer.

The meaning of "heat" in physics is different from its ordinary meaning. For example, in conversation, we may say "the heat was unbearable," but in physics, we would say that the temperature was high. Heat is a form of energy flow, whereas temperature is not. Incidentally, humans are sensitive to heat flow rather than to temperature.

Since heat is a form of energy, its SI unit is the joule (J). Another common unit of energy often used for heat is the calorie (cal), defined as the energy needed to change the temperature of $1.00 \mathrm{~g}$ of water by $1.00^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ -specifically, between $14.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $15.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, since there is a slight temperature dependence. Also commonly used is the kilocalorie (kcal), which is the energy needed to change the temperature of $1.00 \mathrm{~kg}$ of water by $1.00^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Since mass is most often specified in kilograms, the kilocalorie is convenient. Confusingly, food calories (sometimes called "big calories," abbreviated Cal) are actually kilocalories, a fact not easily determined from package labeling.

## Mechanical Equivalent of Heat

It is also possible to change the temperature of a substance by doing work, which transfers energy into or out of a system. This realization helped establish that heat is a form of energy. James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) performed many experiments to establish the mechanical equivalent of heat-the work needed to produce the same effects as heat transfer. In the units used for these two quantities, the value for this equivalence is

$$
1.000 \mathrm{kcal}=4186 \mathrm{~J}
$$

We consider this equation to represent the conversion between two units of energy. (Other numbers that you may see refer to calories defined for temperature ranges other than $14.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $15.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.)

Figure 1.10 shows one of Joule's most famous experimental setups for demonstrating that work and heat can produce the same effects and measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. It helped establish the principle of conservation of energy. Gravitational potential energy (U) was converted into kinetic energy ( $K$ ), and then randomized by viscosity and turbulence into increased average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in the system, producing a temperature increase. Joule's contributions to thermodynamics were so significant that the SI unit of energy was named after him.

Increasing internal energy by heat transfer gives the same result as increasing it by doing work. Therefore, although a system has a well-defined internal energy, we cannot say that it has a certain "heat content" or "work content." A well-defined quantity that depends only on the current state of the system, rather than on the history of that system, is known as a state variable. Temperature and internal energy are state variables. To sum up this paragraph, heat and work are not state variables.

Incidentally, increasing the internal energy of a system does not necessarily increase its temperature. As we'll see in the next section, the temperature does not change when a substance changes from one phase to another. An example is the melting of ice, which can be accomplished by adding heat or by doing frictional work, as when an ice cube is rubbed against a rough surface.

## Temperature Change and Heat Capacity

We have noted that heat transfer often causes temperature change. Experiments show that with no phase change and no work done on or by the system, the transferred heat is typically directly proportional to the change in temperature and to the mass of the system, to a good approximation. (Below we show how to handle situations where the approximation is not valid.) The constant of proportionality depends on the substance and its phase, which may be gas, liquid, or solid. We omit discussion of the fourth phase, plasma, because although it is the most common phase in the universe, it is rare and short-lived on Earth.

We can understand the experimental facts by noting that the transferred heat is the change in the internal energy, which is the total energy of the molecules. Under typical conditions, the total kinetic energy of the molecules $K_{\text {total }}$ is a constant fraction of the internal energy (for reasons and with exceptions that we'll see in the next chapter). The average kinetic energy of a molecule $K_{\text {ave }}$ is proportional to the absolute temperature. Therefore, the change in internal energy of a system is typically proportional to the change in temperature and to the number of molecules, $N$. Mathematically, $\Delta U \propto \Delta K_{\text {total }}=N K_{\text {ave }} \propto N \Delta T$ The dependence on the substance results in large part from the different masses of atoms and molecules. We are considering its heat capacity in terms of its mass, but as we will see in the next chapter, in some cases, heat capacities per molecule are similar for different substances. The dependence on substance and phase also results from differences in the potential energy associated with interactions between atoms and molecules.

## Heat Transfer and Temperature Change

A practical approximation for the relationship between heat transfer and temperature change is:

$$
Q=m c \Delta T
$$

where $Q$ is the symbol for heat transfer ("quantity of heat"), $m$ is the mass of the substance, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. The symbol c stands for the specific heat (also called "specific heat capacity") and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is numerically equal to the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of $1.00 \mathrm{~kg}$ of mass by $1.00^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The SI unit for specific heat is $\mathrm{J} /(\mathrm{kg} \times \mathrm{K})$ or $\mathrm{J} /\left(\mathrm{kg} \times{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. (Recall that the temperature change $\Delta T$ is the same in units of kelvin and degrees Celsius.)

Values of specific heat must generally be measured, because there is no simple way to calculate them precisely. Table 1.3 lists representative values of specific heat for various substances. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass and 10 times that of iron, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of water a given amount as for glass, and 10 times as much as for iron. In fact, water has one of the largest specific heats of any material, which is important for sustaining life on Earth.

The specific heats of gases depend on what is maintained constant during the heating-typically either the volume or the pressure. In the table, the first specific heat value for each gas is measured at constant volume, and the second (in parentheses) is measured at constant pressure. We will return to this topic in the chapter on the kinetic theory of gases.

In general, specific heat also depends on temperature. Thus, a precise definition of $c$ for a substance must be given in terms of an infinitesimal change in temperature. To do this, we note that $c=\frac{1}{m} \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}$ and replace $\Delta$ with $d$ :

$$
c=\frac{1}{m} \frac{d Q}{d T}
$$

Except for gases, the temperature and volume dependence of the specific heat of most substances is weak at normal temperatures. Therefore, we will generally take specific heats to be constant at the values given in the table.

## EXAMPLE 1.5

## Calculating the Required Heat

A $0.500-\mathrm{kg}$ aluminum pan on a stove and $0.250 \mathrm{~L}$ of water in it are heated from $20.0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $80.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. (a) How much heat is required? What percentage of the heat is used to raise the temperature of (b) the pan and (c) the water?

## Strategy

We can assume that the pan and the water are always at the same temperature. When you put the pan on the stove, the temperature of the water and that of the pan are increased by the same amount. We use the equation for the heat transfer for the given temperature change and mass of water and aluminum. The specific heat values for water and aluminum are given in Table 1.3.

## Solution

1. Calculate the temperature difference:

$$
\Delta T=T_{\mathrm{f}}-T_{\mathrm{i}}=60.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

2. Calculate the mass of water. Because the density of water is $1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}, 1 \mathrm{~L}$ of water has a mass of $1 \mathrm{~kg}$, and the mass of $0.250 \mathrm{~L}$ of water is $m_{w}=0.250 \mathrm{~kg}$.
3. Calculate the heat transferred to the water. Use the specific heat of water in Table 1.3:

$$
Q_{\mathrm{w}}=m_{\mathrm{w}} c_{\mathrm{w}} \Delta T=(0.250 \mathrm{~kg})\left(4186 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(60.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=62.8 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

4. Calculate the heat transferred to the aluminum. Use the specific heat for aluminum in Table 1.3:

$$
Q_{\mathrm{Al}}=m_{\mathrm{A} 1} c_{\mathrm{A} 1} \Delta T=(0.500 \mathrm{~kg})\left(900 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(60.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=27.0 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

5. Find the total transferred heat:

$$
Q_{\text {Total }}=Q_{\mathrm{W}}+Q_{\mathrm{Al}}=89.8 \mathrm{~kJ} \text {. }
$$

## Significance

In this example, the heat transferred to the water is more than the aluminum pan. Although the mass of the pan is twice that of the water, the specific heat of water is over four times that of aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more than twice as much heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water as for the aluminum pan.

Example 1.6 illustrates a temperature rise caused by doing work. (The result is the same as if the same amount
of energy had been added with a blowtorch instead of mechanically.)

EXAMPLE 1.6

## Calculating the Temperature Increase from the Work Done on a Substance

Truck brakes used to control speed on a downhill run do work, converting gravitational potential energy into increased internal energy (higher temperature) of the brake material (Figure 1.11). This conversion prevents the gravitational potential energy from being converted into kinetic energy of the truck. Since the mass of the truck is much greater than that of the brake material absorbing the energy, the temperature increase may occur too fast for sufficient heat to transfer from the brakes to the environment; in other words, the brakes may overheat.

Calculate the temperature increase of $10 \mathrm{~kg}$ of brake material with an average specific heat of $800 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ if the material retains $10 \%$ of the energy from a 10,000-kg truck descending $75.0 \mathrm{~m}$ (in vertical displacement) at a constant speed.

## Strategy

We calculate the gravitational potential energy ( $\mathrm{Mgh}$ ) that the entire truck loses in its descent, equate it to the increase in the brakes' internal energy, and then find the temperature increase produced in the brake material alone.

## Solution

First we calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the truck goes downhill:

$$
M g h=(10,000 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(75.0 \mathrm{~m})=7.35 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}
$$

Because the kinetic energy of the truck does not change, conservation of energy tells us the lost potential energy is dissipated, and we assume that $10 \%$ of it is transferred to internal energy of the brakes, so take $Q=M g h / 10$. Then we calculate the temperature change from the heat transferred, using

$$
\Delta T=\frac{Q}{m c}
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the brake material. Insert the given values to find

$$
\Delta T=\frac{7.35 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J}}{(10 \mathrm{~kg})\left(800 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}=92^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

## Significance

If the truck had been traveling for some time, then just before the descent, the brake temperature would probably be higher than the ambient temperature. The temperature increase in the descent would likely raise the temperature of the brake material very high, so this technique is not practical. Instead, the truck would use the technique of engine braking. A different idea underlies the recent technology of hybrid and electric cars, where mechanical energy (kinetic and gravitational potential energy) is converted by the brakes into electrical energy in the battery, a process called regenerative braking.

In a common kind of problem, objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other but isolated from everything else, and they are allowed to come into equilibrium. A container that prevents heat transfer in or out is called a calorimeter, and the use of a calorimeter to make measurements (typically of heat or specific heat capacity) is called calorimetry.

We will use the term "calorimetry problem" to refer to any problem in which the objects concerned are thermally isolated from their surroundings. An important idea in solving calorimetry problems is that during a heat transfer between objects isolated from their surroundings, the heat gained by the colder object must equal the heat lost by the hotter object, due to conservation of energy:

$$
Q_{\text {cold }}+Q_{\text {hot }}=0
$$

We express this idea by writing that the sum of the heats equals zero because the heat gained is usually considered positive; the heat lost, negative.

## EXAMPLE 1.7

## Calculating the Final Temperature in Calorimetry

Suppose you pour $0.250 \mathrm{~kg}$ of $20.0-{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ water (about a cup) into a $0.500-\mathrm{kg}$ aluminum pan off the stove with a temperature of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Assume no heat transfer takes place to anything else: The pan is placed on an insulated pad, and heat transfer to the air is neglected in the short time needed to reach equilibrium. Thus, this is a calorimetry problem, even though no isolating container is specified. Also assume that a negligible amount of water boils off. What is the temperature when the water and pan reach thermal equilibrium?

## Strategy

Originally, the pan and water are not in thermal equilibrium: The pan is at a higher temperature than the water. Heat transfer restores thermal equilibrium once the water and pan are in contact; it stops once thermal equilibrium between the pan and the water is achieved. The heat lost by the pan is equal to the heat gained by the water-that is the basic principle of calorimetry.

## Solution

1. Use the equation for heat transfer $Q=m c \Delta T$ to express the heat lost by the aluminum pan in terms of the mass of the pan, the specific heat of aluminum, the initial temperature of the pan, and the final temperature:

$$
Q_{\mathrm{hot}}=m_{\mathrm{A} 1} c_{\mathrm{A} 1}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

2. Express the heat gained by the water in terms of the mass of the water, the specific heat of water, the initial temperature of the water, and the final temperature:

$$
Q_{\mathrm{cold}}=m_{\mathrm{w}} c_{\mathrm{w}}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

3. Note that $Q_{\text {hot }}<0$ and $Q_{\text {cold }}>0$ and that as stated above, they must sum to zero:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{\mathrm{cold}}+Q_{\mathrm{hot}} & =0 \\
Q_{\mathrm{cold}} & =-Q_{\mathrm{hot}} \\
m_{\mathrm{w}} c_{\mathrm{w}}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) & =-m_{\mathrm{A} 1} c_{\mathrm{A} 1}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

4. Bring all terms involving $T_{\mathrm{f}}$ on the left hand side and all other terms on the right hand side. Solving for $T_{\mathrm{f}}$,

$$
T_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{m_{\mathrm{A} 1} c_{\mathrm{A} 1}\left(150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+m_{\mathrm{w}} c_{\mathrm{w}}\left(20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}{m_{\mathrm{A} 1} c_{\mathrm{A} 1}+m_{\mathrm{w}} c_{\mathrm{w}}}
$$

and insert the numerical values:

$$
T_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{(0.500 \mathrm{~kg})\left(900 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+(0.250 \mathrm{~kg})\left(4186 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}{(0.500 \mathrm{~kg})\left(900 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+(0.250 \mathrm{~kg})\left(4186 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}=59.1{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

## Significance

Why is the final temperature so much closer to $20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ than to $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ? The reason is that water has a greater specific heat than most common substances and thus undergoes a smaller temperature change for a given heat transfer. A large body of water, such as a lake, requires a large amount of heat to increase its temperature appreciably. This explains why the temperature of a lake stays relatively constant during the day even when the temperature change of the air is large. However, the water temperature does change over longer times (e.g., summer to winter).

## EXAMPLE 1.8

## Temperature-Dependent Heat Capacity

At low temperatures, the specific heats of solids are typically proportional to $T^{3}$. The first understanding of this behavior was due to the Dutch physicist Peter Debye, who in 1912, treated atomic oscillations with the quantum theory that Max Planck had recently used for radiation. For instance, a good approximation for the specific heat of salt, $\mathrm{NaCl}$, is $c=3.33 \times 10^{4} \frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}}\left(\frac{T}{321 \mathrm{~K}}\right)^{3}$. The constant $321 \mathrm{~K}$ is called the Debye temperature of $\mathrm{NaCl}, \Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$, and the formula works well when $T<0.04 \Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$. Using this formula, how much heat is required to raise the temperature of $24.0 \mathrm{~g}$ of $\mathrm{NaCl}$ from $5 \mathrm{~K}$ to $15 \mathrm{~K}$ ?

## Solution

Because the heat capacity depends on the temperature, we need to use the equation

$$
c=\frac{1}{m} \frac{d Q}{d T}
$$

We solve this equation for $Q$ by integrating both sides: $Q=m \int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} c d T$.

Then we substitute the given values in and evaluate the integral:

$$
Q=(0.024 \mathrm{~kg}) \int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} 3.33 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}}\left(\frac{T}{321 \mathrm{~K}}\right)^{3} d T=\left.\left(6.04 \times 10^{-4} \frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{K}^{4}}\right) T^{4}\right|_{5 \mathrm{~K}} ^{15 \mathrm{~K}}=0.302 \mathrm{~J}
$$

## Significance

If we had used the equation $Q=m c \Delta T$ and the room-temperature specific heat of salt, $880 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, we would have gotten a very different value.

### 1.5 Phase Changes

Phase transitions play an important theoretical and practical role in the study of heat flow. In melting (or "fusion"), a solid turns into a liquid; the opposite process is freezing. In evaporation, a liquid turns into a gas; the opposite process is condensation.

A substance melts or freezes at a temperature called its melting point, and boils (evaporates rapidly) or condenses at its boiling point. These temperatures depend on pressure. High pressure favors the denser form, so typically, high pressure raises the melting point and boiling point, and low pressure lowers them. For example, the boiling point of water is $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$. At higher pressure, the boiling point is higher, and at lower pressure, it is lower. The main exception is the melting and freezing of water, discussed in the next section.

## Phase Diagrams

The phase of a given substance depends on the pressure and temperature. Thus, plots of pressure versus temperature showing the phase in each region provide considerable insight into thermal properties of substances. Such a $p T$ graph is called a phase diagram.

Figure 1.12 shows the phase diagram for water. Using the graph, if you know the pressure and temperature, you can determine the phase of water. The solid curves-boundaries between phases-indicate phase transitions, that is, temperatures and pressures at which the phases coexist. For example, the boiling point of water is $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature rises gradually to $374^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at a pressure of $218 \mathrm{~atm}$. A pressure cooker (or even a covered pot) cooks food faster than an open pot, because the water can exist as a liquid at temperatures greater than $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ without all boiling away. (As we'll see in the next section, liquid water conducts heat better than steam or hot air.) The boiling point curve ends at a certain point called the critical point-that is, a critical temperature, above which the liquid and gas phases cannot be distinguished; the substance is called a supercritical fluid. At sufficiently high pressure above the critical point, the gas has the density of a liquid but does not condense. Carbon dioxide, for example, is supercritical at all temperatures above $31.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Critical pressure is the pressure of the critical point.

Similarly, the curve between the solid and liquid regions in Figure 1.12 gives the melting temperature at various pressures. For example, the melting point is $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$, as expected. Water has the unusual property that ice is less dense than liquid water at the melting point, so at a fixed temperature, you can change the phase from solid (ice) to liquid (water) by increasing the pressure. That is, the melting temperature of ice falls with increased pressure, as the phase diagram shows. For example, when a car is driven over snow, the increased pressure from the tires melts the snowflakes; afterwards, the water refreezes and forms an ice layer.

As you learned in the earlier section on thermometers and temperature scales, the triple point is the combination of temperature and pressure at which ice, liquid water, and water vapor can coexist stably-that is, all three phases exist in equilibrium. For water, the triple point occurs at $273.16 \mathrm{~K}\left(0.01^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and $611.2 \mathrm{~Pa}$; that is a more accurate calibration temperature than the melting point of water at $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$, or $273.15 \mathrm{~K}\left(0.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

At pressures below that of the triple point, there is no liquid phase; the substance can exist as either gas or solid. For water, there is no liquid phase at pressures below $0.00600 \mathrm{~atm}$. The phase change from solid to gas is called sublimation. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water, or that ice cubes can disappear in a freezer. Both are examples of sublimation. The reverse also happens: Frost can form on very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. Figure 1.13 shows the result, as well as showing a familiar example of sublimation. Carbon dioxide has no liquid phase at atmospheric pressure. Solid $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is known as dry ice because instead of melting, it sublimes. Its sublimation temperature at atmospheric pressure is $-78^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Certain air fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to spread a perfume around a room. Some solids, such as osmium tetroxide, are so toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-produced vapors.

## Equilibrium

At the melting temperature, the solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium. If heat is added, some of the solid will melt, and if heat is removed, some of the liquid will freeze. The situation is somewhat more complex for
liquid-gas equilibrium. Generally, liquid and gas are in equilibrium at any temperature. We call the gas phase a vapor when it exists at a temperature below the boiling temperature, as it does for water at $20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Liquid in a closed container at a fixed temperature evaporates until the pressure of the gas reaches a certain value, called the vapor pressure, which depends on the gas and the temperature. At this equilibrium, if heat is added, some of the liquid will evaporate, and if heat is removed, some of the gas will condense; molecules either join the liquid or form suspended droplets. If there is not enough liquid for the gas to reach the vapor pressure in the container, all the liquid eventually evaporates.

If the vapor pressure of the liquid is greater than the total ambient pressure, including that of any air (or other gas), the liquid evaporates rapidly; in other words, it boils. Thus, the boiling point of a liquid at a given pressure is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure. Liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium at the boiling temperature (Figure 1.14). If a substance is in a closed container at the boiling point, then the liquid is boiling and the gas is condensing at the same rate without net change in their amounts.

For water, $100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is the boiling point at $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$, so water and steam should exist in equilibrium under these conditions. Why does an open pot of water at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ boil completely away? The gas surrounding an open pot is not pure water: it is mixed with air. If pure water and steam are in a closed container at $100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$, they will coexist-but with air over the pot, there are fewer water molecules to condense, and water boils away. Another way to see this is that at the boiling point, the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure. However, part of the ambient pressure is due to air, so the pressure of the steam is less than the vapor pressure at that temperature, and evaporation continues. Incidentally, the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero, a fact that accounts for sublimation.

## Phase Change and Latent Heat

So far, we have discussed heat transfers that cause temperature change. However, in a phase transition, heat
transfer does not cause any temperature change.

For an example of phase changes, consider the addition of heat to a sample of ice at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Figure 1.15) and atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the ice rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate of $2090 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until it reaches $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Once at this temperature, the ice begins to melt and continues until it has all melted, absorbing $333 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$ of heat. The temperature remains constant at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted, the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate of $4186 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. At $100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the water begins to boil. The temperature again remains constant during this phase change while the water absorbs $2256 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$ of heat and turns into steam. When all the liquid has become steam, the temperature rises again, absorbing heat at a rate of $2020 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If we started with steam and cooled it to make it condense into liquid water and freeze into ice, the process would exactly reverse, with the temperature again constant during each phase transition.

Where does the heat added during melting or boiling go, considering that the temperature does not change until the transition is complete? Energy is required to melt a solid, because the attractive forces between the molecules in the solid must be broken apart, so that in the liquid, the molecules can move around at comparable kinetic energies; thus, there is no rise in temperature. Energy is needed to vaporize a liquid for similar reasons. Conversely, work is done by attractive forces when molecules are brought together during freezing and condensation. That energy must be transferred out of the system, usually in the form of heat, to allow the molecules to stay together (Figure 1.18). Thus, condensation occurs in association with cold objects-the glass in Figure 1.16, for example.

The energy released when a liquid freezes is used by orange growers when the temperature approaches $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Growers spray water on the trees so that the water freezes and heat is released to the growing oranges. This prevents the temperature inside the orange from dropping below freezing, which would damage the fruit (Figure 1.17).

The energy involved in a phase change depends on the number of bonds or force pairs and their strength. The number of bonds is proportional to the number of molecules and thus to the mass of the sample. The energy per unit mass required to change a substance from the solid phase to the liquid phase, or released when the substance changes from liquid to solid, is known as the heat of fusion. The energy per unit mass required to change a substance from the liquid phase to the vapor phase is known as the heat of vaporization. The strength of the forces depends on the type of molecules. The heat $Q$ absorbed or released in a phase change in a sample of mass $m$ is given by

$$
Q=m L_{\mathrm{f}}(\text { melting/freezing })
$$

$$
Q=m L_{\mathrm{v}}(\text { vaporization/condensation })
$$

where the latent heat of fusion $L_{\mathrm{f}}$ and latent heat of vaporization $L_{\mathrm{v}}$ are material constants that are determined experimentally. (Latent heats are also called latent heat coefficients and heats of transformation.)

These constants are "latent," or hidden, because in phase changes, energy enters or leaves a system without causing a temperature change in the system, so in effect, the energy is hidden.

Table 1.4 lists representative values of $L_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $L_{\mathrm{V}}$ in $\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$, together with melting and boiling points. Note that in general, $L_{\mathrm{v}}>L_{\mathrm{f}}$. The table shows that the amounts of energy involved in phase changes can easily be comparable to or greater than those involved in temperature changes, as Figure 1.15 and the accompanying discussion also showed.

Table 1.4 Heats of Fusion and Vaporization ${ }^{[1]} \quad{ }^{[1]}$ Values quoted at the normal melting and boiling temperatures at standard atmospheric pressure ( $1 \mathrm{~atm}) .{ }^{[2]} \mathrm{Helium}$ has no solid phase at atmospheric pressure. The melting point given is at a pressure of $2.5 \mathrm{MPa} .{ }^{[3]} \mathrm{At} 37.0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (body temperature), the heat of vaporization $L_{\mathrm{v}}$ for water is $2430 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$ or $580 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot{ }^{[4]} \mathrm{At} 37.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (body temperature), the heat of vaporization, $L_{\mathrm{v}}$ for water is $2430 \mathrm{~kJ} /$ $\mathrm{kg}$ or $580 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$.

Phase changes can have a strong stabilizing effect on temperatures that are not near the melting and boiling points, since evaporation and condensation occur even at temperatures below the boiling point. For example, air temperatures in humid climates rarely go above approximately $38.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ because most heat transfer goes into evaporating water into the air. Similarly, temperatures in humid weather rarely fall below the dew point-the temperature where condensation occurs given the concentration of water vapor in the air-because so much heat is released when water vapor condenses.

More energy is required to evaporate water below the boiling point than at the boiling point, because the kinetic energy of water molecules at temperatures below $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is less than that at $100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so less energy is available from random thermal motions. For example, at body temperature, evaporation of sweat from the skin requires a heat input of $2428 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$, which is about $10 \%$ higher than the latent heat of vaporization at $100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This heat comes from the skin, and this evaporative cooling effect of sweating helps reduce the body temperature in hot weather. However, high humidity inhibits evaporation, so that body temperature might rise, while unevaporated sweat might be left on your brow.

## EXAMPLE 1.9

## Calculating Final Temperature from Phase Change

Three ice cubes are used to chill a soda at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with mass $m_{\text {soda }}=0.25 \mathrm{~kg}$. The ice is at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and each ice cube has a mass of $6.0 \mathrm{~g}$. Assume that the soda is kept in a foam container so that heat loss can be ignored and that the soda has the same specific heat as water. Find the final temperature when all ice has melted.

## Strategy

The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting. Melting yields water at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so more heat is transferred from the soda to this water until the water plus soda system reaches thermal equilibrium.

The heat transferred to the ice is

$$
Q_{\text {ice }}=m_{\text {ice }} L_{\mathrm{f}}+m_{\text {ice }} c_{\mathrm{W}}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

The heat given off by the soda is

$$
Q_{\text {soda }}=m_{\text {soda }} c_{\mathrm{W}}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

Since no heat is lost, $Q_{\text {ice }}=-Q_{\text {soda }}$, as in Example 1.7, so that

$$
m_{\text {ice }} L_{\mathrm{f}}+m_{\text {ice }} c_{\mathrm{W}}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=-m_{\text {soda }} c_{\mathrm{W}}\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

Solve for the unknown quantity $T_{\mathrm{f}}$ :

$$
T_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{m_{\text {soda }} c_{\mathrm{w}}\left(20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)-m_{\mathrm{ice}} L_{\mathrm{f}}}{\left(m_{\text {soda }}+m_{\text {ice }}\right) c_{\mathrm{w}}}
$$

## Solution

First we identify the known quantities. The mass of ice is $m_{\mathrm{ice}}=3 \times 6.0 \mathrm{~g}=0.018 \mathrm{~kg}$ and the mass of soda is $m_{\text {soda }}=0.25 \mathrm{~kg}$. Then we calculate the final temperature:

$$
T_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{20,930 \mathrm{~J}-6012 \mathrm{~J}}{1122 \mathrm{~J} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}=13{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

## Significance

This example illustrates the large energies involved during a phase change. The mass of ice is about $7 \%$ of the mass of the soda but leads to a noticeable change in the temperature of the soda. Although we assumed that the ice was at the freezing temperature, this is unrealistic for ice straight out of a freezer: The typical temperature is $-6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. However, this correction makes no significant change from the result we found. Can you explain why?

Like solid-liquid and liquid-vapor transitions, direct solid-vapor transitions or sublimations involve heat. The energy transferred is given by the equation $Q=m L_{\mathrm{s}}$, where $L_{\mathrm{S}}$ is the heat of sublimation, analogous to $L_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $L_{\mathrm{v}}$. The heat of sublimation at a given temperature is equal to the heat of fusion plus the heat of vaporization at that temperature.

We can now calculate any number of effects related to temperature and phase change. In each case, it is necessary to identify which temperature and phase changes are taking place. Keep in mind that heat transfer and work can cause both temperature and phase changes.

## PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

## The Effects of Heat Transfer

1. Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When it is not obvious whether a phase change occurs or not, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps-temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on.
2. Identify and list all objects that change temperature or phase.
3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.
4. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat of the substance (Heat Transfer. Specific Heat, and Calorimetry), and if there is a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat of the substance (Table 1.4).
5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).
6. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You may need to do this in steps if there is more than one state to the process, such as a temperature change followed by a phase change. However, in a calorimetry problem, each step corresponds to a term in the single equation $Q_{\text {hot }}+Q_{\text {cold }}=0$.
7. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable. Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that any temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

### 1.6 Mechanisms of Heat Transfer

Just as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which it occurs. Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. It may occur rapidly, as through a cooking pan, or slowly, as through the walls of a picnic ice chest. So many processes involve heat transfer that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. Yet every heat transfer takes place by only three methods:

1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale-we know that thermal motion of the atoms and molecules occurs at any temperature above absolute zero.) Heat transferred from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is transferred by conduction.
2. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example.
3. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of Earth by the Sun. A less obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body.

In the illustration at the beginning of this chapter, the fire warms the snowshoers' faces largely by radiation. Convection carries some heat to them, but most of the air flow from the fire is upward (creating the familiar shape of flames), carrying heat to the food being cooked and into the sky. The snowshoers wear clothes designed with low conductivity to prevent heat flow out of their bodies.

In this section, we examine these methods in some detail. Each method has unique and interesting characteristics, but all three have two things in common: They transfer heat solely because of a temperature difference, and the greater the temperature difference, the faster the heat transfer (Figure 1.19).

## Conduction

As you walk barefoot across the living room carpet in a cold house and then step onto the kitchen tile floor, your feet feel colder on the tile. This result is intriguing, since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature. The different sensation is explained by the different rates of heat transfer: The heat loss is faster for skin in contact with the tiles than with the carpet, so the sensation of cold is more intense.

Some materials conduct thermal energy faster than others. Figure 1.20 shows a material that conducts heat slowly-it is a good thermal insulator, or poor heat conductor-used to reduce heat flow into and out of a house.

A molecular picture of heat conduction will help justify the equation that describes it. Figure 1.21 shows molecules in two bodies at different temperatures, $T_{\mathrm{h}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, for "hot" and "cold." The average kinetic energy of a molecule in the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two molecules collide, energy transfers from the high-energy to the low-energy molecule. In a metal, the picture would also include free valence electrons colliding with each other and with atoms, likewise transferring energy. The cumulative effect of all collisions is a net flux of heat from the hotter body to the colder body. Thus, the rate of heat transfer increases with increasing temperature difference $\Delta T=T_{\mathrm{h}}-T_{\mathrm{c}}$. If the temperatures are the same, the net heat transfer rate is zero. Because the number of collisions increases with increasing area, heat conduction is proportional to the cross-sectional area-a second factor in the equation.

A third quantity that affects the conduction rate is the thickness of the material through which heat transfers. Figure 1.22 shows a slab of material with a higher temperature on the left than on the right. Heat transfers from the left to the right by a series of molecular collisions. The greater the distance between hot and cold, the more time the material takes to transfer the same amount of heat.

All four of these quantities appear in a simple equation deduced from and confirmed by experiments. The rate of conductive heat transfer through a slab of material, such as the one in Figure 1.22, is given by

$$
P=\frac{d Q}{d t}=\frac{k A\left(T_{\mathrm{h}}-T_{\mathrm{c}}\right)}{d}
$$

where $P$ is the power or rate of heat transfer in watts or in kilocalories per second, $A$ and $d$ are its surface area and thickness, as shown in Figure 1.22, $T_{\mathrm{h}}-T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the temperature difference across the slab, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material. Table 1.5 gives representative values of thermal conductivity.

More generally, we can write

$$
P=-k A \frac{d T}{d x}
$$

where $x$ is the coordinate in the direction of heat flow. Since in Figure 1.22, the power and area are constant, $d T / d x$ is constant, and the temperature decreases linearly from $T_{\mathrm{h}}$ to $T_{\mathrm{c}}$.

## EXAMPLE 1.10

## Calculating Heat Transfer through Conduction

A polystyrene foam icebox has a total area of $0.950 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and walls with an average thickness of $2.50 \mathrm{~cm}$. The box contains ice, water, and canned beverages at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The inside of the box is kept cold by melting ice. How much ice melts in one day if the icebox is kept in the trunk of a car at $35.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ?

## Strategy

This question involves both heat for a phase change (melting of ice) and the transfer of heat by conduction. To find the amount of ice melted, we must find the net heat transferred. This value can be obtained by calculating the rate of heat transfer by conduction and multiplying by time.

## Solution

First we identify the knowns.

$k=0.010 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for polystyrene foam; $A=0.950 \mathrm{~m}^{2} ; d=2.50 \mathrm{~cm}=0.0250 \mathrm{~m} ; ; T_{\mathrm{c}}=0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} ; T_{\mathrm{h}}=35.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$;

$t=1$ day $=24$ hours $-86,400 \mathrm{~s}$.

Then we identify the unknowns. We need to solve for the mass of the ice, $m$. We also need to solve for the net heat transferred to melt the ice, $Q$. The rate of heat transfer by conduction is given by

$$
P=\frac{d Q}{d t}=\frac{k A\left(T_{\mathrm{h}}-T_{\mathrm{c}}\right)}{d}
$$

The heat used to melt the ice is $Q=m L_{\mathrm{f}}$.We insert the known values:

$$
P=\frac{\left(0.010 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(0.950 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)\left(35.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}{0.0250 \mathrm{~m}}=13.3 \mathrm{~W}
$$

Multiplying the rate of heat transfer by the time we obtain

$$
Q=P t=(13.3 \mathrm{~W})(86.400 \mathrm{~s})=1.15 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}
$$

We set this equal to the heat transferred to melt the ice, $Q=m L_{\mathrm{f}}$, and solve for the mass $m$ :

$$
m=\frac{Q}{L_{\mathrm{f}}}=\frac{1.15 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}}{334 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}}=3.44 \mathrm{~kg}
$$

## Significance

The result of $3.44 \mathrm{~kg}$, or about $7.6 \mathrm{lb}$, seems about right, based on experience. You might expect to use about a $4 \mathrm{~kg}(7-10 \mathrm{lb})$ bag of ice per day. A little extra ice is required if you add any warm food or beverages.

Table 1.5 shows that polystyrene foam is a very poor conductor and thus a good insulator. Other good insulators include fiberglass, wool, and goosedown feathers. Like polystyrene foam, these all contain many small pockets of air, taking advantage of air's poor thermal conductivity.

In developing insulation, the smaller the conductivity $k$ and the larger the thickness $d$, the better. Thus, the ratio $d / k$, called the $R$ factor, is large for a good insulator. The rate of conductive heat transfer is inversely proportional to $R$. $R$ factors are most commonly quoted for household insulation, refrigerators, and the like. Unfortunately, in the United States, $R$ is still in non-metric units of $\mathrm{ft}{ }^{2} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{h} / \mathrm{Btu}$, although the unit usually goes unstated [1 British thermal unit (Btu) is the amount of energy needed to change the temperature of $1.0 \mathrm{lb}$ of water by $1.0^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which is $1055.1 \mathrm{~J}$ ]. A couple of representative values are an $R$ factor of 11 for 3.5 -inch-thick fiberglass batts (pieces) of insulation and an $R$ factor of 19 for 6.5 -inch-thick fiberglass batts (Figure 1.23). In the US, walls are usually insulated with 3.5 -inch batts, whereas ceilings are usually insulated with 6.5 -inch batts. In cold climates, thicker batts may be used.

Note that in Table 1.5, most of the best thermal conductors-silver, copper, gold, and aluminum-are also the best electrical conductors, because they contain many free electrons that can transport thermal energy. (Diamond, an electrical insulator, conducts heat by atomic vibrations.) Cooking utensils are typically made from good conductors, but the handles of those used on the stove are made from good insulators (bad conductors).

EXAMPLE 1.11

## Two Conductors End to End

A steel rod and an aluminum rod, each of diameter $1.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ and length $25.0 \mathrm{~cm}$, are welded end to end. One end of the steel rod is placed in a large tank of boiling water at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, while the far end of the aluminum rod is placed in a large tank of water at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The rods are insulated so that no heat escapes from their surfaces. What is the temperature at the joint, and what is the rate of heat conduction through this composite rod?

## Strategy

The heat that enters the steel rod from the boiling water has no place to go but through the steel rod, then through the aluminum rod, to the cold water. Therefore, we can equate the rate of conduction through the steel to the rate of conduction through the aluminum.

We repeat the calculation with a second method, in which we use the thermal resistance $R$ of the rod, since it simply adds when two rods are joined end to end. (We will use a similar method in the chapter on directcurrent circuits.)

## Solution

1. Identify the knowns and convert them to SI units.

The length of each rod is $L_{\mathrm{A} 1}=L_{\text {steel }}=0.25 \mathrm{~m}$, the cross-sectional area of each rod is $A_{\mathrm{A} 1}=A_{\text {steel }}=7.85 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, the thermal conductivity of aluminum is $k_{\mathrm{A} 1}=220 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the thermal conductivity of steel is $k_{\text {steel }}=80 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the temperature at the hot end is $T=100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and the temperature at the cold end is $T=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

2. Calculate the heat-conduction rate through the steel rod and the heat-conduction rate through the aluminum rod in terms of the unknown temperature $T$ at the joint:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{\text {steel }} & =\frac{k_{\text {steel }} A_{\text {steel }} \Delta T_{\text {steel }}}{L_{\text {steel }}} \\
& =\frac{\left(80 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(7.85 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)\left(100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-T\right)}{0.25 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =\left(0.0251 \mathrm{~W} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-T\right) \\
P_{\mathrm{A} 1} & =\frac{k_{\mathrm{Al}} A_{\mathrm{A} 1} \Delta T_{\mathrm{Al}}}{L_{\mathrm{A} 1}} \\
& =\frac{\left(220 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(7.85 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)\left(T-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)}{0.25 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =\left(0.0691 \mathrm{~W} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(T-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

3. Set the two rates equal and solve for the unknown temperature:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(0.0691 \mathrm{~W} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(T-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) & =\left(0.0251 \mathrm{~W} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-T\right) \\
T & =41.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{aligned}
$$

4. Calculate either rate:

$$
P_{\text {steel }}=\left(0.0251 \mathrm{~W} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-41.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)=1.47 \mathrm{~W}
$$

5. If desired, check your answer by calculating the other rate.

## Solution

1. Recall that $R=L / k$. Now $P=A \Delta T / R$, or $\Delta T=P R / A$.
2. We know that $\Delta T_{\text {steel }}+\Delta T_{\mathrm{Al}}=100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. We also know that $P_{\text {steel }}=P_{\mathrm{Al}}$, and we denote that rate of heat flow by $P$. Combine the equations:

$$
\frac{P R_{\text {steel }}}{A}+\frac{P R_{\mathrm{Al}}}{A}=80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

Thus, we can simply add $R$ factors. Now, $P=\frac{80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}{A\left(R_{\mathrm{steel}}+R_{\mathrm{Al}}\right)}$.

3. Find the $R_{S}$ from the known quantities:

$$
R_{\text {steel }}=3.13 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{W}
$$

and

$$
R_{\mathrm{Al}}=1.14 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{W}
$$

4. Substitute these values in to find $P=1.47 \mathrm{~W}$ as before.
5. Determine $\Delta T$ for the aluminum rod (or for the steel rod) and use it to find $T$ at the joint.

$$
\Delta T_{\mathrm{Al}}=\frac{P R_{\mathrm{Al}}}{A}=\frac{(1.47 \mathrm{~W})\left(1.14 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{W}\right)}{7.85 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2}}=21.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

so $T=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}+21.3{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=41.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, as in Solution 1 .

6. If desired, check by determining $\Delta T$ for the other rod.

## Significance

In practice, adding $R$ values is common, as in calculating the $R$ value of an insulated wall. In the analogous situation in electronics, the resistance corresponds to $A R$ in this problem and is additive even when the areas are unequal, as is common in electronics. Our equation for heat conduction can be used only when the areas are equal; otherwise, we would have a problem in three-dimensional heat flow, which is beyond our scope.

Conduction is caused by the random motion of atoms and molecules. As such, it is an ineffective mechanism for heat transport over macroscopic distances and short times. For example, the temperature on Earth would be unbearably cold during the night and extremely hot during the day if heat transport in the atmosphere were only through conduction. Also, car engines would overheat unless there was a more efficient way to remove excess heat from the pistons. The next module discusses the important heat-transfer mechanism in such situations.

## Convection

In convection, thermal energy is carried by the large-scale flow of matter. It can be divided into two types. In forced convection, the flow is driven by fans, pumps, and the like. A simple example is a fan that blows air past you in hot surroundings and cools you by replacing the air heated by your body with cooler air. A more complicated example is the cooling system of a typical car, in which a pump moves coolant through the radiator and engine to cool the engine and a fan blows air to cool the radiator.

In free or natural convection, the flow is driven by buoyant forces: hot fluid rises and cold fluid sinks because density decreases as temperature increases. The house in Figure 1.24 is kept warm by natural convection, as is the pot of water on the stove in Figure 1.25. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation, which result from the buoyancy of warm air and water, transfer hot air from the tropics toward the poles and cold air from the poles toward the tropics. (Earth's rotation interacts with those flows, causing the observed eastward flow of air in the temperate zones.)

Convection is usually more complicated than conduction. Beyond noting that the convection rate is often approximately proportional to the temperature difference, we will not do any quantitative work comparable to the formula for conduction. However, we can describe convection qualitatively and relate convection rates to heat and time. Air is a poor conductor, so convection dominates heat transfer by air. Therefore, the amount of available space for airflow determines whether air transfers heat rapidly or slowly. There is little heat transfer in a space filled with air with a small amount of other material that prevents flow. The space between the inside and outside walls of a typical American house, for example, is about $9 \mathrm{~cm}$ ( $3.5 \mathrm{in}$.$) -large enough for convection$ to work effectively. The addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. On the other hand, the gap between the two panes of a double-paned window is about $1 \mathrm{~cm}$, which largely prevents convection and takes advantage of air's low conductivity reduce heat loss. Fur, cloth, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by trapping it in spaces too small to support convection (Figure 1.26).

Some interesting phenomena happen when convection is accompanied by a phase change. The combination allows us to cool off by sweating even if the temperature of the surrounding air exceeds body temperature. Heat from the skin is required for sweat to evaporate from the skin, but without air flow, the air becomes saturated and evaporation stops. Air flow caused by convection replaces the saturated air by dry air and evaporation continues.

## EXAMPLE 1.12

## Calculating the Flow of Mass during Convection

The average person produces heat at the rate of about $120 \mathrm{~W}$ when at rest. At what rate must water evaporate from the body to get rid of all this energy? (For simplicity, we assume this evaporation occurs when a person is sitting in the shade and surrounding temperatures are the same as skin temperature, eliminating heat transfer by other methods.)

## Strategy

Energy is needed for this phase change $\left(Q=m L_{v}\right)$. Thus, the energy loss per unit time is

$$
\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{m L_{\mathrm{V}}}{t}=120 \mathrm{~W}=120 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s}
$$

We divide both sides of the equation by $L_{v}$ to find that the mass evaporated per unit time is

$$
\frac{m}{t}=\frac{120 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s}}{L_{\mathrm{v}}}
$$

## Solution

Insert the value of the latent heat from Table 1.4, $L_{v}=2430 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}=2430 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}$. This yields

$$
\frac{m}{t}=\frac{120 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s}}{2430 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g}}=0.0494 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{s}=2.96 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{min}
$$

## Significance

Evaporating about $3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{min}$ seems reasonable. This would be about $180 \mathrm{~g}$ (about $7 \mathrm{oz}$.$) per hour. If the air is very$ dry, the sweat may evaporate without even being noticed. A significant amount of evaporation also takes place in the lungs and breathing passages.

Another important example of the combination of phase change and convection occurs when water evaporates from the oceans. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, possibly far from the ocean, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as $20.0 \mathrm{~km}$ into the stratosphere (Figure 1.27). Water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. This energy causes the air to expand and rise to colder altitudes. More condensation occurs in these regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. This mechanism is an example of positive feedback, since the process reinforces and accelerates itself. It sometimes produces violent storms, with lightning and hail. The same mechanism drives hurricanes.

## Radiation

You can feel the heat transfer from the Sun. The space between Earth and the Sun is largely empty, so the Sun warms us without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking inside-it may just warm you as you walk by. In these examples, heat is transferred by radiation (Figure 1.28). That is, the hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by the skin. No medium is required for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Different names are used for electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, $\mathrm{X}$-rays, and gamma rays.

The energy of electromagnetic radiation varies over a wide range, depending on the wavelength: A shorter wavelength (or higher frequency) corresponds to a higher energy. Because more heat is radiated at higher temperatures, higher temperatures produce more intensity at every wavelength but especially at shorter wavelengths. In visible light, wavelength determines color-red has the longest wavelength and violet the shortest-so a temperature change is accompanied by a color change. For example, an electric heating element on a stove glows from red to orange, while the higher-temperature steel in a blast furnace glows from yellow to white. Infrared radiation is the predominant form radiated by objects cooler than the electric element and the steel. The radiated energy as a function of wavelength depends on its intensity, which is represented in Figure 1.29 by the height of the distribution. (Electromagnetic Waves explains more about the electromagnetic spectrum, and Photons and Matter Waves discusses why the decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in energy.)

The rate of heat transfer by radiation also depends on the object's color. Black is the most effective, and white is the least effective. On a clear summer day, black asphalt in a parking lot is hotter than adjacent gray sidewalk, because black absorbs better than gray (Figure 1.30). The reverse is also true-black radiates better than gray. Thus, on a clear summer night, the asphalt is colder than the gray sidewalk, because black radiates the energy more rapidly than gray. A perfectly black object would be an ideal radiator and an ideal absorber, as it would capture all the radiation that falls on it. In contrast, a perfectly white object or a perfect mirror would reflect all radiation, and a perfectly transparent object would transmit it all (Figure 1.31). Such objects would not emit any radiation. Mathematically, the color is represented by the emissivity e. A "blackbody" radiator would have an $e=1$, whereas a perfect reflector or transmitter would have $e=0$. For real examples, tungsten light bulb filaments have an $e$ of about 0.5 , and carbon black (a material used in printer toner) has an emissivity of about 0.95 .

To see that, consider a silver object and a black object that can exchange heat by radiation and are in thermal equilibrium. We know from experience that they will stay in equilibrium (the result of a principle that will be discussed at length in Second Law of Thermodynamics). For the black object's temperature to stay constant, it must emit as much radiation as it absorbs, so it must be as good at radiating as absorbing. Similar considerations show that the silver object must radiate as little as it absorbs. Thus, one property, emissivity, controls both radiation and absorption.

Finally, the radiated heat is proportional to the object's surface area, since every part of the surface radiates. If you knock apart the coals of a fire, the radiation increases noticeably due to an increase in radiating surface area.

The rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation:

$$
P=\sigma A e T^{4}
$$

where $\sigma=5.67 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}^{4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, a combination of fundamental constants of nature; $A$ is the surface area of the object; and $T$ is its temperature in kelvins.

The proportionality to the fourth power of the absolute temperature is a remarkably strong temperature dependence. It allows the detection of even small temperature variations. Images called thermographs can be used medically to detect regions of abnormally high temperature in the body, perhaps indicative of disease. Similar techniques can be used to detect heat leaks in homes (Figure 1.32), optimize performance of blast furnaces, improve comfort levels in work environments, and even remotely map Earth's temperature profile.

The Stefan-Boltzmann equation needs only slight refinement to deal with a simple case of an object's absorption of radiation from its surroundings. Assuming that an object with a temperature $T_{1}$ is surrounded by an environment with uniform temperature $\boldsymbol{T}_{2}$, the net rate of heat transfer by radiation is

$$
P_{\mathrm{net}}=\sigma e A\left(T_{2}^{4}-T_{1}^{4}\right)
$$

where $e$ is the emissivity of the object alone. In other words, it does not matter whether the surroundings are white, gray, or black: The balance of radiation into and out of the object depends on how well it emits and absorbs radiation. When $T_{2}>T_{1}$, the quantity $P_{\text {net }}$ is positive, that is, the net heat transfer is from hot to cold. Before doing an example, we have a complication to discuss: different emissivities at different wavelengths. If the fraction of incident radiation an object reflects is the same at all visible wavelengths, the object is gray; if the fraction depends on the wavelength, the object has some other color. For instance, a red or reddish object reflects red light more strongly than other visible wavelengths. Because it absorbs less red, it radiates less red when hot. Differential reflection and absorption of wavelengths outside the visible range have no effect on what we see, but they may have physically important effects. Skin is a very good absorber and emitter of infrared radiation, having an emissivity of 0.97 in the infrared spectrum. Thus, in spite of the obvious variations in skin color, we are all nearly black in the infrared. This high infrared emissivity is why we can so easily feel radiation on our skin. It is also the basis for the effectiveness of night-vision scopes used by law enforcement and the military to detect human beings.

EXAMPLE 1.13

## Calculating the Net Heat Transfer of a Person

What is the rate of heat transfer by radiation of an unclothed person standing in a dark room whose ambient temperature is $22.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ? The person has a normal skin temperature of $33.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and a surface area of $1.50 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The emissivity of skin is 0.97 in the infrared, the part of the spectrum where the radiation takes place.

## Strategy

We can solve this by using the equation for the rate of radiative heat transfer.

## Solution

Insert the temperature values $T_{2}=295 \mathrm{~K}$ and $T_{1}=306 \mathrm{~K}$, so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{Q}{t} & =\sigma e A\left(T_{2}{ }^{4}-T_{1}{ }^{4}\right) \\
& =\left(5.67 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}^{4}\right)(0.97)\left(1.50 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)\left[(295 \mathrm{~K})^{4}-(306 \mathrm{~K})^{4}\right] \\
& =-99 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s}=-99 \mathrm{~W} .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

This value is a significant rate of heat transfer to the environment (note the minus sign), considering that a person at rest may produce energy at the rate of $125 \mathrm{~W}$ and that conduction and convection are also transferring energy to the environment. Indeed, we would probably expect this person to feel cold. Clothing significantly reduces heat transfer to the environment by all mechanisms, because clothing slows down both conduction and convection, and has a lower emissivity (especially if it is light-colored) than skin.

The average temperature of Earth is the subject of much current discussion. Earth is in radiative contact with both the Sun and dark space, so we cannot use the equation for an environment at a uniform temperature. Earth receives almost all its energy from radiation of the Sun and reflects some of it back into outer space. Conversely, dark space is very cold, about $3 \mathrm{~K}$, so that Earth radiates energy into the dark sky. The rate of heat transfer from soil and grasses can be so rapid that frost may occur on clear summer evenings, even in warm latitudes.

The average temperature of Earth is determined by its energy balance. To a first approximation, it is the temperature at which Earth radiates heat to space as fast as it receives energy from the Sun.

An important parameter in calculating the temperature of Earth is its emissivity (e). On average, it is about 0.65 , but calculation of this value is complicated by the great day-to-day variation in the highly reflective cloud coverage. Because clouds have lower emissivity than either oceans or land masses, they emit some of the radiation back to the surface, greatly reducing heat transfer into dark space, just as they greatly reduce heat transfer into the atmosphere during the day. There is negative feedback (in which a change produces an effect that opposes that change) between clouds and heat transfer; higher temperatures evaporate more water to form more clouds, which reflect more radiation back into space, reducing the temperature.

The often-mentioned greenhouse effect is directly related to the variation of Earth's emissivity with wavelength (Figure 1.33). The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon responsible for providing temperatures suitable for life on Earth and for making Venus unsuitable for human life. Most of the infrared radiation emitted from Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ and water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ in the atmosphere and then re-radiated into outer space or back to Earth. Re-radiation back to Earth maintains its surface temperature about $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ higher than it would be if there were no atmosphere. (The glass walls and roof of a greenhouse increase the temperature inside by blocking convective heat losses, not radiative losses.)

The greenhouse effect is central to the discussion of global warming due to emission of carbon dioxide and methane (and other greenhouse gases) into Earth's atmosphere from industry, transportation, and farming. Changes in global climate could lead to more intense storms, precipitation changes (affecting agriculture), reduction in rain forest biodiversity, and rising sea levels.

## PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEG

## Effects of Heat Transfer

1. Examine the situation to determine what type of heat transfer is involved.
2. Identify the type(s) of heat transfer-conduction, convection, or radiation.
3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.
4. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).
5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).
6. For conduction, use the equation $P=\frac{k A \Delta T}{d}$. Table 1.5 lists thermal conductivities. For convection, determine the amount of matter moved and the equation $Q=m c \Delta T$, along with $Q=m L_{\mathrm{f}}$ or $Q=m L_{\mathrm{V}}$ if
a substance changes phase. For radiation, the equation $P_{\text {net }}=\sigma e A\left(T_{2}{ }^{4}-T_{1}{ }^{4}\right)$ gives the net heat transfer rate.
7. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units.
8. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable. Does it make sense?
