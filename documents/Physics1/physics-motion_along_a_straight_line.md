# CHAPTER 3 <br> Motion Along a Straight Line 

INTRODUCTION Our universe is full of objects in motion. From the stars, planets, and galaxies; to the motion of people and animals; down to the microscopic scale of atoms and molecules-everything in our universe is in motion. We can describe motion using the two disciplines of kinematics and dynamics. We study dynamics, which is concerned with the causes of motion, in Newton's Laws of Motion; but, there is much to be learned about motion without referring to what causes it, and this is the study of kinematics. Kinematics involves describing motion through properties such as position, time, velocity, and acceleration.

A full treatment of kinematics considers motion in two and three dimensions. For now, we discuss motion in
one dimension, which provides us with the tools necessary to study multidimensional motion. A good example of an object undergoing one-dimensional motion is the maglev (magnetic levitation) train depicted at the beginning of this chapter. As it travels, say, from Tokyo to Kyoto, it is at different positions along the track at various times in its journey, and therefore has displacements, or changes in position. It also has a variety of velocities along its path and it undergoes accelerations (changes in velocity). With the skills learned in this chapter we can calculate these quantities and average velocity. All these quantities can be described using kinematics, without knowing the train's mass or the forces involved.

### 3.1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity

When you're in motion, the basic questions to ask are: Where are you? Where are you going? How fast are you getting there? The answers to these questions require that you specify your position, your displacement, and your average velocity-the terms we define in this section.

## Position

To describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe its position (x): where it is at any particular time. More precisely, we need to specify its position relative to a convenient frame of reference. A frame of reference is an arbitrary set of axes from which the position and motion of an object are described. Earth is often used as a frame of reference, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects on Earth. For example, a rocket launch could be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, whereas a cyclist's position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the buildings she passes Figure 3.2. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. To describe the position of an object undergoing onedimensional motion, we often use the variable $x$. Later in the chapter, during the discussion of free fall, we use the variable $y$.

## Displacement

If an object moves relative to a frame of reference-for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a whiteboard Figure 3.3-then the object's position changes. This change in position is called displacement. The
word displacement implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced. Although position is the numerical value of $x$ along a straight line where an object might be located, displacement gives the change in position along this line. Since displacement indicates direction, it is a vector and can be either positive or negative, depending on the choice of positive direction. Also, an analysis of motion can have many displacements embedded in it. If right is positive and an object moves $2 \mathrm{~m}$ to the right, then $4 \mathrm{~m}$ to the left, the individual displacements are $2 \mathrm{~m}$ and $-4 \mathrm{~m}$, respectively.

## Displacement

Displacement $\Delta x$ is the change in position of an object:

$$
\Delta x=x_{\mathrm{f}}-x_{0}
$$

where $\Delta x$ is displacement, $x_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the final position, and $x_{0}$ is the initial position.

We use the uppercase Greek letter delta ( $\Delta$ ) to mean "change in" whatever quantity follows it; thus, $\Delta x$ means change in position (final position less initial position). We always solve for displacement by subtracting initial position $x_{0}$ from final position $x_{\mathrm{f}}$. Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter, but sometimes we use kilometers or other units of length. Keep in mind that when units other than meters are used in a problem, you may need to convert them to meters to complete the calculation (see Appendix B).

Objects in motion can also have a series of displacements. In the previous example of the pacing professor, the individual displacements are $2 \mathrm{~m}$ and $-4 \mathrm{~m}$, giving a total displacement of $-2 \mathrm{~m}$. We define total displacement $\Delta x_{\text {Total }}$, as the sum of the individual displacements, and express this mathematically with the equation

$$
\Delta x_{\text {Total }}=\sum \Delta x_{i}
$$

where $\Delta x_{i}$ are the individual displacements. In the earlier example,

$$
\Delta x_{1}=x_{1}-x_{0}=2-0=2 \mathrm{~m}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\Delta x_{2}=x_{2}-x_{1}=-2-(2)=-4 \mathrm{~m}
$$

Thus,

$$
\Delta x_{\text {Total }}=\Delta x_{1}+\Delta x_{2}=2-4=-2 \mathrm{~m}
$$

The total displacement is $2-4=-2 \mathrm{~m}$ along the $x$-axis. It is also useful to calculate the magnitude of the displacement, or its size. The magnitude of the displacement is always positive. This is the absolute value of the displacement, because displacement is a vector and cannot have a negative value of magnitude. In our example, the magnitude of the total displacement is $2 \mathrm{~m}$, whereas the magnitudes of the individual displacements are $2 \mathrm{~m}$ and $4 \mathrm{~m}$.

The magnitude of the total displacement should not be confused with the distance traveled. Distance traveled $x_{\text {Total }}$, is the total length of the path traveled between two positions. In the previous problem, the distance traveled is the sum of the magnitudes of the individual displacements:

$$
x_{\text {Total }}=\left|\Delta x_{1}\right|+\left|\Delta x_{2}\right|=2+4=6 \mathrm{~m}
$$

## Average Velocity

To calculate the other physical quantities in kinematics we must introduce the time variable. The time variable allows us not only to state where the object is (its position) during its motion, but also how fast it is moving. How fast an object is moving is given by the rate at which the position changes with time.

For each position $x_{\mathrm{i}}$, we assign a particular time $t_{\mathrm{i}}$. If the details of the motion at each instant are not important, the rate is usually expressed as the average velocity $\bar{v}$. This vector quantity is simply the total displacement between two points divided by the time taken to travel between them. The time taken to travel between two points is called the elapsed time $\Delta t$.

## Average Velocity

If $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the positions of an object at times $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, respectively, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Average velocity }=\bar{v}=\frac{\text { Displacement between two points }}{\text { Elapsed time between two points }} \\
& \qquad \bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

It is important to note that the average velocity is a vector and can be negative, depending on positions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$.

## EXAMPLE 3.1

## Delivering Flyers

Jill sets out from her home to deliver flyers for her yard sale, traveling due east along her street lined with houses. At $0.5 \mathrm{~km}$ and 9 minutes later she runs out of flyers and has to retrace her steps back to her house to get more. This takes an additional 9 minutes. After picking up more flyers, she sets out again on the same path, continuing where she left off, and ends up $1.0 \mathrm{~km}$ from her house. This third leg of her trip takes 15 minutes. At this point she turns back toward her house, heading west. After $1.75 \mathrm{~km}$ and 25 minutes she stops to rest.

a. What is Jill's total displacement to the point where she stops to rest?

b. What is the magnitude of the final displacement?

c. What is the average velocity during her entire trip?
d. What is the total distance traveled?

e. Make a graph of position versus time.

A sketch of Jill's movements is shown in Figure 3.4.

## Strategy

The problem contains data on the various legs of Jill's trip, so it would be useful to make a table of the physical quantities. We are given position and time in the wording of the problem so we can calculate the displacements and the elapsed time. We take east to be the positive direction. From this information we can find the total displacement and average velocity. Jill's home is the starting point $x_{0}$. The following table gives Jill's time and position in the first two columns, and the displacements are calculated in the third column.

Time $t_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathbf{m i n}) \quad$ Position $x_{i}(\mathbf{k m}) \quad$ Displacement $\Delta x_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathbf{k m})$

| $t_{0}=0$ | $x_{0}=0$ | $\Delta x_{0}=0$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $t_{1}=9$ | $x_{1}=0.5$ | $\Delta x_{1}=x_{1}-x_{0}=0.5$ |
| $t_{2}=18$ | $x_{2}=0$ | $\Delta x_{2}=x_{2}-x_{1}=-0.5$ |
| $t_{3}=33$ | $x_{3}=1.0$ | $\Delta x_{3}=x_{3}-x_{2}=1.0$ |
| $t_{4}=58$ | $x_{4}=-0.75$ | $\Delta x_{4}=x_{4}-x_{3}=-1.75$ |

## Solution

a. From the above table, the total displacement is

$$
\sum \Delta x_{\mathrm{i}}=0.5-0.5+1.0-1.75 \mathrm{~km}=-0.75 \mathrm{~km}
$$

b. The magnitude of the total displacement is $|-0.75| \mathrm{km}=0.75 \mathrm{~km}$.

c. Average velocity $=\frac{\text { Total displacement }}{\text { Elapsed time }}=\bar{v}=\frac{-0.75 \mathrm{~km}}{58 \mathrm{~min}}=-0.013 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{min}$

d. The total distance traveled (sum of magnitudes of individual displacements) is $x_{\text {Total }}=\sum\left|\Delta x_{i}\right|=0.5+0.5+1.0+1.75 \mathrm{~km}=3.75 \mathrm{~km}$.

e. We can graph Jill's position versus time as a useful aid to see the motion; the graph is shown in Figure 3.5.

## Significance

Jill's total displacement is $-0.75 \mathrm{~km}$, which means at the end of her trip she ends up $0.75 \mathrm{~km}$ due west of her home. The average velocity means if someone was to walk due west at $0.013 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{min}$ starting at the same time Jill left her home, they both would arrive at the final stopping point at the same time. Note that if Jill were to end her trip at her house, her total displacement would be zero, as well as her average velocity. The total distance traveled during the 58 minutes of elapsed time for her trip is $3.75 \mathrm{~km}$.

### 3.2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed

We have now seen how to calculate the average velocity between two positions. However, since objects in the real world move continuously through space and time, we would like to find the velocity of an object at any single point. We can find the velocity of the object anywhere along its path by using some fundamental principles of calculus. This section gives us better insight into the physics of motion and will be useful in later chapters.

## Instantaneous Velocity

The quantity that tells us how fast an object is moving anywhere along its path is the instantaneous velocity, usually called simply velocity. It is the average velocity between two points on the path in the limit that the time (and therefore the displacement) between the two points approaches zero. To illustrate this idea mathematically, we need to express position $x$ as a continuous function of $t$ denoted by $x(t)$. The expression for the average velocity between two points using this notation is $\bar{v}=\frac{x\left(t_{2}\right)-x\left(t_{1}\right)}{t_{2}-t_{1}}$. To find the instantaneous velocity at any position, we let $t_{1}=t$ and $t_{2}=t+\Delta t$. After inserting these expressions into the equation for the average velocity and taking the limit as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$, we find the expression for the instantaneous velocity:

$$
v(t)=\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{x(t+\Delta t)-x(t)}{\Delta t}=\frac{d x(t)}{d t}
$$

## Instantaneous Velocity

The instantaneous velocity of an object is the limit of the average velocity as the elapsed time approaches zero, or the derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$ :

$$
v(t)=\frac{d}{d t} x(t)
$$

Like average velocity, instantaneous velocity is a vector with dimension of length per time. The instantaneous velocity at a specific time point $t_{0}$ is the rate of change of the position function, which is the slope of the position function $x(t)$ at $t_{0}$. Figure 3.6 shows how the average velocity $\bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ between two times approaches the instantaneous velocity at $t_{0}$. The instantaneous velocity is shown at time $t_{0}$, which happens to be at the maximum of the position function. The slope of the position graph is zero at this point, and thus the instantaneous velocity is zero. At other times, $t_{1}, t_{2}$, and so on, the instantaneous velocity is not zero because the slope of the position graph would be positive or negative. If the position function had a minimum, the slope of the position graph would also be zero, giving an instantaneous velocity of zero there as well. Thus, the zeros of the velocity function give the minimum and maximum of the position function.

$$
v\left(t_{0}\right)=\text { slope of tangent line }
$$

## EXAMPLE 3.2

## Finding Velocity from a Position-Versus-Time Graph

Given the position-versus-time graph of Figure 3.7, find the velocity-versus-time graph.

## Strategy

The graph contains three straight lines during three time intervals. We find the velocity during each time interval by taking the slope of the line using the grid.

## Solution

Time interval $0 \mathrm{~s}$ to $0.5 \mathrm{~s}: \bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{0.5 \mathrm{~m}-0.0 \mathrm{~m}}{0.5 \mathrm{~s}-0.0 \mathrm{~s}}=1.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

Time interval $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$ to $1.0 \mathrm{~s}: \bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{0.5 \mathrm{~m}-0.5 \mathrm{~m}}{1.0 \mathrm{~s}-0.5 \mathrm{~s}}=0.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

Time interval $1.0 \mathrm{~s}$ to $2.0 \mathrm{~s}: \bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{0.0 \mathrm{~m}-0.5 \mathrm{~m}}{2.0 \mathrm{~s}-1.0 \mathrm{~s}}=-0.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

The graph of these values of velocity versus time is shown in Figure 3.8.

## Significance

During the time interval between $0 \mathrm{~s}$ and $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$, the object's position is moving away from the origin and the position-versus-time curve has a positive slope. At any point along the curve during this time interval, we can find the instantaneous velocity by taking its slope, which is $+1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, as shown in Figure 3.8. In the subsequent time interval, between $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$ and $1.0 \mathrm{~s}$, the position doesn't change and we see the slope is zero. From $1.0 \mathrm{~s}$ to $2.0 \mathrm{~s}$, the object is moving back toward the origin and the slope is $-0.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. The object has reversed direction
and has a negative velocity.

## Speed

In everyday language, most people use the terms speed and velocity interchangeably. In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning and are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction; that is, speed is a scalar.

We can calculate the average speed by finding the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time:

$$
\text { Average speed }=\bar{s}=\frac{\text { Total distance }}{\text { Elapsed time }}
$$

Average speed is not necessarily the same as the magnitude of the average velocity, which is found by dividing the magnitude of the total displacement by the elapsed time. For example, if a trip starts and ends at the same location, the total displacement is zero, and therefore the average velocity is zero. The average speed, however, is not zero, because the total distance traveled is greater than zero. If we take a road trip of $300 \mathrm{~km}$ and need to be at our destination at a certain time, then we would be interested in our average speed.

However, we can calculate the instantaneous speed from the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity:

$$
\text { Instantaneous speed }=|v(t)|
$$

If a particle is moving along the $x$-axis at $+7.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and another particle is moving along the same axis at -7.0 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$, they have different velocities, but both have the same speed of $7.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Some typical speeds are shown in the following table.

| Speed | $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ | $\mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Continental drift | $10^{-7}$ | $2 \times 10^{-7}$ |
| Brisk walk | 1.7 | 3.9 |
| Cyclist | 4.4 | 10 |
| Sprint runner | 12.2 | 27 |
| Rural speed limit | 24.6 | 56 |
| Official land speed record | 341.1 | 763 |
| Speed of sound at sea level | 343 | 768 |
| Space shuttle on reentry | 7800 | 17,500 |
| Escape velocity of Earth* | 11,200 | 25,000 |
| Orbital speed of Earth around the Sun | 29,783 | 66,623 |
| Speed of light in a vacuum | $299,792,458$ | $670,616,629$ |

Table 3.1 Speeds of Various Objects "Escape velocity is the velocity at which an object must be launched so that it overcomes Earth's gravity and is not pulled back toward Earth.

## Calculating Instantaneous Velocity

When calculating instantaneous velocity, we need to specify the explicit form of the position function $x(t)$. If each term in the $x(t)$ equation has the form of $A t^{n}$ where $A$ is a constant and $n$ is an integer, this can be differentiated using the power rule to be:

$$
\frac{d\left(A t^{n}\right)}{d t}=A n t^{n-1}
$$

Note that if there are additional terms added together, this power rule of differentiation can be done multiple times and the solution is the sum of those terms. The following example illustrates the use of Equation 3.7.

## EXAMPLE 3.3

## Instantaneous Velocity Versus Average Velocity

The position of a particle is given by $x(t)=3.0 t+0.5 t^{3} \mathrm{~m}$.

a. Using Equation 3.4 and Equation 3.7, find the instantaneous velocity at $t=2.0 \mathrm{~s}$.

b. Calculate the average velocity between $1.0 \mathrm{~s}$ and $3.0 \mathrm{~s}$.

## Strategy

Equation 3.4 gives the instantaneous velocity of the particle as the derivative of the position function. Looking at the form of the position function given, we see that it is a polynomial in $t$. Therefore, we can use Equation 3.7, the power rule from calculus, to find the solution. We use Equation 3.6 to calculate the average velocity of the particle.

## Solution

a. $v(t)=\frac{d x(t)}{d t}=3.0+1.5 t^{2} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

Substituting $t=2.0 \mathrm{~s}$ into this equation gives $v(2.0 \mathrm{~s})=\left[3.0+1.5(2.0)^{2}\right] \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}=9.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

b. To determine the average velocity of the particle between $1.0 \mathrm{~s}$ and $3.0 \mathrm{~s}$, we calculate the values of $x(1.0 \mathrm{~s})$ and $x(3.0 \mathrm{~s})$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
x(1.0 \mathrm{~s})=\left[(3.0)(1.0)+0.5(1.0)^{3}\right] \mathrm{m}=3.5 \mathrm{~m} \\
x(3.0 \mathrm{~s})=\left[(3.0)(3.0)+0.5(3.0)^{3}\right] \mathrm{m}=22.5 \mathrm{~m}
\end{gathered}
$$

Then the average velocity is

$$
\bar{v}=\frac{x(3.0 \mathrm{~s})-x(1.0 \mathrm{~s})}{t(3.0 \mathrm{~s})-t(1.0 \mathrm{~s})}=\frac{22.5-3.5 \mathrm{~m}}{3.0-1.0 \mathrm{~s}}=9.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

In the limit that the time interval used to calculate $\bar{v}$ goes to zero, the value obtained for $\bar{v}$ converges to the value of $v$.

## EXAMPLE 3.4

## Instantaneous Velocity Versus Speed

Consider the motion of a particle in which the position is $x(t)=3.0 t-3 t^{2} \mathrm{~m}$.

a. What is the instantaneous velocity at $t=0.25 \mathrm{~s}, t=0.50 \mathrm{~s}$, and $t=1.0 \mathrm{~s}$ ?

b. What is the speed of the particle at these times?

## Strategy

The instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position function and the speed is the magnitude of the
instantaneous velocity. We use Equation 3.4 and Equation 3.7 to solve for instantaneous velocity.

## Solution

a. $\quad v(t)=\frac{d x(t)}{d t}=3.0-6.0 t \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} v(0.25 \mathrm{~s})=1.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v(0.5 \mathrm{~s})=0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v(1.0 \mathrm{~s})=-3.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

b. Speed $=|v(t)|=1.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, 0.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, and $3.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

## Significance

The velocity of the particle gives us direction information, indicating the particle is moving to the left (west) or right (east). The speed gives the magnitude of the velocity. By graphing the position, velocity, and speed as functions of time, we can understand these concepts visually Figure 3.9. In (a), the graph shows the particle moving in the positive direction until $t=0.5 \mathrm{~s}$, when it reverses direction. The reversal of direction can also be seen in (b) at $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$ where the velocity is zero and then turns negative. At $1.0 \mathrm{~s}$ it is back at the origin where it started. The particle's velocity at $1.0 \mathrm{~s}$ in (b) is negative, because it is traveling in the negative direction. But in (c), however, its speed is positive and remains positive throughout the travel time. We can also interpret velocity as the slope of the position-versus-time graph. The slope of $x(t)$ is decreasing toward zero, becoming zero at $0.5 \mathrm{~s}$ and increasingly negative thereafter. This analysis of comparing the graphs of position, velocity, and speed helps catch errors in calculations. The graphs must be consistent with each other and help interpret the calculations.

### 3.3 Average and Instantaneous Acceleration

The importance of understanding acceleration spans our day-to-day experience, as well as the vast reaches of outer space and the tiny world of subatomic physics. In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up; applying the brake pedal causes a vehicle to slow down. We are familiar with the acceleration of our car, for example. The greater the acceleration, the greater the change in velocity over a given time. Acceleration is
widely seen in experimental physics. In linear particle accelerator experiments, for example, subatomic particles are accelerated to very high velocities in collision experiments, which tell us information about the structure of the subatomic world as well as the origin of the universe. In space, cosmic rays are subatomic particles that have been accelerated to very high energies in supernovas (exploding massive stars) and active galactic nuclei. It is important to understand the processes that accelerate cosmic rays because these rays contain highly penetrating radiation that can damage electronics flown on spacecraft, for example.

## Average Acceleration

The formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these notions just described, but is more inclusive.

## Average Acceleration

Average acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes:

$$
\bar{a}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v_{\mathrm{f}}-v_{0}}{t_{\mathrm{f}}-t_{0}}
$$

where $\bar{a}$ is average acceleration, $v$ is velocity, and $t$ is time. (The bar over the a means average acceleration.)

Because acceleration is velocity in meters per second divided by time in seconds, the SI units for acceleration are often abbreviated $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}-$ that is, meters per second squared or meters per second per second. This literally means by how many meters per second the velocity changes every second. Recall that velocity is a vector-it has both magnitude and direction-which means that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or speed), but it can also be a change in direction. For example, if a runner traveling at $10 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ due east slows to a stop, reverses direction, and continues her run at $10 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ due west, her velocity has changed as a result of the change in direction, although the magnitude of the velocity is the same in both directions. Thus, acceleration occurs when velocity changes in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed) or in direction, or both.

## Acceleration as a Vector

Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the change in velocity, $\Delta v$. Since velocity is a vector, it can change in magnitude or in direction, or both. Acceleration is, therefore, a change in speed or direction, or both.

Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of motion. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion. Although this is commonly referred to as deceleration Figure 3.10, we say the train is accelerating in a direction opposite to its direction of motion.

The term deceleration can cause confusion in our analysis because it is not a vector and it does not point to a specific direction with respect to a coordinate system, so we do not use it. Acceleration is a vector, so we must choose the appropriate sign for it in our chosen coordinate system. In the case of the train in Figure 3.10, acceleration is in the negative direction in the chosen coordinate system, so we say the train is undergoing negative acceleration.

If an object in motion has a velocity in the positive direction with respect to a chosen origin and it acquires a constant negative acceleration, the object eventually comes to a rest and reverses direction. If we wait long enough, the object passes through the origin going in the opposite direction. This is illustrated in Figure 3.11.

## Calculating Average Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate

A racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity of $15.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ due west in $1.80 \mathrm{~s}$. What is its average acceleration?

## Strategy

First we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem Figure 3.13. This is a simple problem, but it always helps to visualize it. Notice that we assign east as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this case, we have negative velocity.

We can solve this problem by identifying $\Delta v$ and $\Delta t$ from the given information, and then calculating the average acceleration directly from the equation $\bar{a}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v_{\mathrm{f}}-v_{0}}{t_{\mathrm{f}}-t_{0}}$.

## Solution

First, identify the knowns: $v_{0}=0, v_{\mathrm{f}}=-15.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ (the negative sign indicates direction toward the west), $\Delta t=$ $1.80 \mathrm{~s}$.

Second, find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to $-15.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, its change in velocity equals its final velocity:

$$
\Delta v=v_{\mathrm{f}}-v_{0}=v_{\mathrm{f}}=-15.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

Last, substitute the known values $(\Delta v$ and $\Delta t)$ and solve for the unknown $\bar{a}$ :

$$
\bar{a}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{-15.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{1.80 \mathrm{~s}}=-8.33 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}
$$

## Significance

The negative sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward the west. An acceleration of $8.33 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ due west means the horse increases its velocity by $8.33 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ due west each second; that is, 8.33 meters per second per second, which we write as $8.33 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. This is truly an average acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We see later that an acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on with a force nearly equal to his weight.

## Instantaneous Acceleration

Instantaneous acceleration a, or acceleration at a specific instant in time, is obtained using the same process discussed for instantaneous velocity. That is, we calculate the average acceleration between two points in time separated by $\Delta t$ and let $\Delta t$ approach zero. The result is the derivative of the velocity function $v(t)$, which is instantaneous acceleration and is expressed mathematically as

$$
a(t)=\frac{d}{d t} v(t)
$$

Thus, similar to velocity being the derivative of the position function, instantaneous acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function. We can show this graphically in the same way as instantaneous velocity. In Figure 3.14, instantaneous acceleration at time $t_{0}$ is the slope of the tangent line to the velocity-versus-time graph at time $t_{0}$. We see that average acceleration $\bar{a}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ approaches instantaneous acceleration as $\Delta t$ approaches zero. Also in part (a) of the figure, we see that velocity has a maximum when its slope is zero. This time corresponds to the zero of the acceleration function. In part (b), instantaneous acceleration at the minimum velocity is shown, which is also zero, since the slope of the curve is zero there, too. Thus, for a given velocity function, the zeros of the acceleration function give either the minimum or the maximum velocity.

$$
a\left(t_{0}\right)=\text { slope of tangent line }
$$

To illustrate this concept, let's look at two examples. First, a simple example is shown using Figure 3.9(b), the velocity-versus-time graph of Example 3.4, to find acceleration graphically. This graph is depicted in Figure 3.15(a), which is a straight line. The corresponding graph of acceleration versus time is found from the slope of velocity and is shown in Figure 3.15(b). In this example, the velocity function is a straight line with a constant slope, thus acceleration is a constant. In the next example, the velocity function has a more complicated functional dependence on time.

If we know the functional form of velocity, $v(t)$, we can calculate instantaneous acceleration $a(t)$ at any time point in the motion using Equation 3.9.

## EXAMPLE 3.6

## Calculating Instantaneous Acceleration

A particle is in motion and is accelerating. The functional form of the velocity is $v(t)=20 t-5 t^{2} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

a. Find the functional form of the acceleration.

b. Find the instantaneous velocity at $t=1,2,3$, and $5 \mathrm{~s}$.

c. Find the instantaneous acceleration at $t=1,2,3$, and $5 \mathrm{~s}$.

d. Interpret the results of (c) in terms of the directions of the acceleration and velocity vectors.

## Strategy

We find the functional form of acceleration by taking the derivative of the velocity function. Then, we calculate the values of instantaneous velocity and acceleration from the given functions for each. For part (d), we need to compare the directions of velocity and acceleration at each time.

## Solution

a. $a(t)=\frac{d v(t)}{d t}=20-10 t \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$
b. $\quad v(1 \mathrm{~s})=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v(2 \mathrm{~s})=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v(3 \mathrm{~s})=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v(5 \mathrm{~s})=-25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
c. $a(1 \mathrm{~s})=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}, a(2 \mathrm{~s})=0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}, a(3 \mathrm{~s})=-10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}, a(5 \mathrm{~s})=-30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$

d. At $t=1 \mathrm{~s}$, velocity $v(1 \mathrm{~s})=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ is positive and acceleration is positive, so both velocity and acceleration are in the same direction. The particle is moving faster.

At $t=2 \mathrm{~s}$, velocity has increased $\operatorname{tov}(2 \mathrm{~s})=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, where it is maximum, which corresponds to the time when the acceleration is zero. We see that the maximum velocity occurs when the slope of the velocity function is zero, which is just the zero of the acceleration function.

At $t=3 \mathrm{~s}$, velocity is $v(3 \mathrm{~s})=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and acceleration is negative. The particle has reduced its velocity and the acceleration vector is negative. The particle is slowing down.

At $t=5 \mathrm{~s}$, velocity is $v(5 \mathrm{~s})=-25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and acceleration is increasingly negative. Between the times $t=3 \mathrm{~s}$ and $t$ $=5 \mathrm{~s}$ the particle has decreased its velocity to zero and then become negative, thus reversing its direction. The particle is now speeding up again, but in the opposite direction.

## Significance

By doing both a numerical and graphical analysis of velocity and acceleration of the particle, we can learn much about its motion. The numerical analysis complements the graphical analysis in giving a total view of the motion. The zero of the acceleration function corresponds to the maximum of the velocity in this example. Also in this example, when acceleration is positive and in the same direction as velocity, velocity increases. As acceleration tends toward zero, eventually becoming negative, the velocity reaches a maximum, after which it starts decreasing. If we wait long enough, velocity also becomes negative, indicating a reversal of direction. A real-world example of this type of motion is a car with a velocity that is increasing to a maximum, after which it starts slowing down, comes to a stop, then reverses direction.

## Getting a Feel for Acceleration

You are probably used to experiencing acceleration when you step into an elevator, or step on the gas pedal in your car. However, acceleration is happening to many other objects in our universe with which we don't have direct contact. Table 3.2 presents the acceleration of various objects. We can see the magnitudes of the accelerations extend over many orders of magnitude.

| Acceleration | Value $\left(\mathbf{m} / \mathbf{s}^{2}\right)$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| High-speed train | 0.25 |
| Elevator | 2 |
| Cheetah | 5 |
| Object in a free fall without air resistance near the surface of Earth | 9.8 |
| Space shuttle maximum during launch | 29 |
| Parachutist peak during normal opening of parachute | 59 |
| F16 aircraft pulling out of a dive | 79 |
| Explosive seat ejection from aircraft | 147 |
| Sprint missile | 982 |
| Fastest rocket sled peak acceleration | 1540 |
| Jumping flea | 3200 |
| Baseball struck by a bat | 30,000 |
| Closing jaws of a trap-jaw ant | $1,000,000$ |
| Proton in the large Hadron collider | $1.9 \times 10^{9}$ |

Table 3.2 Typical Values of Acceleration (credit: Wikipedia: Orders of Magnitude (acceleration))

In this table, we see that typical accelerations vary widely with different objects and have nothing to do with object size or how massive it is. Acceleration can also vary widely with time during the motion of an object. A drag racer has a large acceleration just after its start, but then it tapers off as the vehicle reaches a constant velocity. Its average acceleration can be quite different from its instantaneous acceleration at a particular time during its motion. Figure 3.17 compares graphically average acceleration with instantaneous acceleration for two very different motions.

### 3.4 Motion with Constant Acceleration

You might guess that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from a stop sign, the greater the car's displacement in a given time. But, we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and displacement. In this section, we look at some convenient equations for kinematic relationships, starting from the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. We first investigate a single object in motion, called single-body motion. Then we investigate the motion of two objects, called two-body pursuit problems.

## Notation

First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is $\Delta t=t_{\mathrm{f}}-t_{0}$, taking $t_{0}=0$ means that $\Delta t=t_{\mathrm{f}}$, the final time on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and velocity. That is, $x_{0}$ is the initial position and $v_{0}$ is the initial velocity. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is, $t$ is the final time, $x$ is the final position, and $v$ is the final velocity. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed time, $\Delta t=t$. It also simplifies the expression for $x$ displacement, which is now $\Delta x=x-x_{0}$. Also, it simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is now $\Delta v=v-v_{0}$. To summarize, using the simplified notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta t=t \\
& \Delta x=x-x_{0} \\
& \Delta v=v-v_{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

where the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in whatever motion is under consideration.

We now make the important assumption that acceleration is constant. This assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equal-that is,

$$
\bar{a}=a=\text { constant. }
$$

Thus, we can use the symbol a for acceleration at all times. Assuming acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit the situations we can study nor does it degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing, acceleration is constant in a great number of situations. Furthermore, in many other situations we can describe motion accurately by assuming a constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion. Lastly, for motion during which acceleration changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, motion can be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant acceleration.

## Displacement and Position from Velocity

To get our first two equations, we start with the definition of average velocity:

$$
\bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

Substituting the simplified notation for $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ yields

$$
\bar{v}=\frac{x-x_{0}}{t}
$$

Solving for $x$ gives us

$$
x=x_{0}+\bar{v} t
$$

where the average velocity is

$$
\bar{v}=\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}
$$

The equation $\bar{v}=\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}$ reflects the fact that when acceleration is constant, $\bar{v}$ is just the simple average of the initial and final velocities. Figure 3.18 illustrates this concept graphically. In part (a) of the figure, acceleration is constant, with velocity increasing at a constant rate. The average velocity during the 1-h interval from 40 $\mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h}$ to $80 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ is $60 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ :

$$
\bar{v}=\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}=\frac{40 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}+80 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}}{2}=60 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}
$$

In part (b), acceleration is not constant. During the 1-h interval, velocity is closer to $80 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ than $40 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$. Thus, the average velocity is greater than in part (a).

## Solving for Final Velocity from Acceleration and Time

We can derive another useful equation by manipulating the definition of acceleration:

$$
a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$

Substituting the simplified notation for $\Delta v$ and $\Delta t$ gives us

$$
a=\frac{v-v_{0}}{t}(\text { constant } a)
$$

Solving for vyields

$$
v=v_{0}+a t \quad(\text { constant } a)
$$

## EXAMPLE 3.7

## Calculating Final Velocity

An airplane lands with an initial velocity of $70.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and then accelerates opposite to the motion at $1.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ for $40.0 \mathrm{~s}$. What is its final velocity?

## Strategy

First, we identify the knowns: $v_{0}=70 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, a=-1.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}, t=40 \mathrm{~s}$.

Second, we identify the unknown; in this case, it is final velocity $v_{\mathrm{f}}$.

Last, we determine which equation to use. To do this we figure out which kinematic equation gives the unknown in terms of the knowns. We calculate the final velocity using Equation 3.12, $v=v_{0}+a t$.

## Solution

Substitute the known values and solve:

$$
v=v_{0}+a t=70.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}+\left(-1.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(40.0 \mathrm{~s})=10.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

The final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired when slowing down, but is still positive (see figure). With jet engines, reverse thrust can be maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it backward, which is indicated by a negative final velocity, but is not the case here.

In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation $v=v_{0}+a t$ gives us insight into the relationships among velocity, acceleration, and time. We can see, for example, that

- Final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and how long it lasts
- If the acceleration is zero, then the final velocity equals the initial velocity $\left(v=v_{0}\right)$, as expected (in other words, velocity is constant)
- If a is negative, then the final velocity is less than the initial velocity

All these observations fit our intuition. Note that it is always useful to examine basic equations in light of our intuition and experience to check that they do indeed describe nature accurately.

## Solving for Final Position with Constant Acceleration

We can combine the previous equations to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final position of an object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with

$$
v=v_{0}+a t
$$

Adding $v_{0}$ to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives

$$
\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}=v_{0}+\frac{1}{2} a t
$$

Since $\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}=\bar{v}$ for constant acceleration, we have

$$
\bar{v}=v_{0}+\frac{1}{2} a t
$$

Now we substitute this expression for $\bar{v}$ into the equation for displacement, $x=x_{0}+\bar{v} t$, yielding

$$
x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \quad(\text { constant } a)
$$

## EXAMPLE 3.8

## Calculating Displacement of an Accelerating Object

Dragsters can achieve an average acceleration of $26.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Suppose a dragster accelerates from rest at this rate for $5.56 \mathrm{~s}$ Figure 3.20. How far does it travel in this time?

## Strategy

First, let's draw a sketch Figure 3.21. We are asked to find displacement, which is $x$ if we take $x_{0}$ to be zero. (Think about $x_{0}$ as the starting line of a race. It can be anywhere, but we call it zero and measure all other positions relative to it.) We can use the equation $x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ when we identify $v_{0}, a$, and $t$ from the statement of the problem.

## Solution

First, we need to identify the knowns. Starting from rest means that $v_{0}=0$, $a$ is given as $26.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and $t$ is given as $5.56 \mathrm{~s}$.

Second, we substitute the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown:

$$
x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

Since the initial position and velocity are both zero, this equation simplifies to

$$
x=\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

Substituting the identified values of $a$ and $t$ gives

$$
x=\frac{1}{2}\left(26.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(5.56 \mathrm{~s})^{2}=402 \mathrm{~m}
$$

## Significance

If we convert $402 \mathrm{~m}$ to miles, we find that the distance covered is very close to one-quarter of a mile, the
standard distance for drag racing. So, our answer is reasonable. This is an impressive displacement to cover in only $5.56 \mathrm{~s}$, but top-notch dragsters can do a quarter mile in even less time than this. If the dragster were given an initial velocity, this would add another term to the distance equation. If the same acceleration and time are used in the equation, the distance covered would be much greater.

What else can we learn by examining the equation $x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ ? We can see the following relationships:

- Displacement depends on the square of the elapsed time when acceleration is not zero. In Example 3.8, the dragster covers only one-fourth of the total distance in the first half of the elapsed time.
- If acceleration is zero, then initial velocity equals average velocity $\left(v_{0}=\bar{v}\right)$, and $x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ becomes $x=x_{0}+v_{0} t$.


## Solving for Final Velocity from Distance and Acceleration

A fourth useful equation can be obtained from another algebraic manipulation of previous equations. If we solve $v=v_{0}+a t$ for $t$, we get

$$
t=\frac{v-v_{0}}{a}
$$

Substituting this and $\bar{v}=\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}$ into $x=x_{0}+\bar{v} t$, we get

$$
v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2 a\left(x-x_{0}\right)(\text { constant } a)
$$

## EXAMPLE 3.9

## Calculating Final Velocity

Calculate the final velocity of the dragster in Example 3.8 without using information about time.

## Strategy

The equation $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2 a\left(x-x_{0}\right)$ is ideally suited to this task because it relates velocities, acceleration, and displacement, and no time information is required.

## Solution

First, we identify the known values. We know that $v_{0}=0$, since the dragster starts from rest. We also know that $x-x_{0}=402 \mathrm{~m}$ (this was the answer in Example 3.8). The average acceleration was given by $a=26.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

Second, we substitute the knowns into the equation $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2 a\left(x-x_{0}\right)$ and solve for $v$.

$$
v^{2}=0+2\left(26.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(402 \mathrm{~m})
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
v^{2} & =2.09 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
v & =\sqrt{2.09 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}=145 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

A velocity of $145 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ is about $522 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$, or about $324 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$, but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for the quarter mile. Also, note that a square root has two values; we took the positive value to indicate a velocity in the same direction as the acceleration.

An examination of the equation $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2 a\left(x-x_{0}\right)$ can produce additional insights into the general
relationships among physical quantities:

- The final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and the distance over which it acts.
- For a fixed acceleration, a car that is going twice as fast doesn't simply stop in twice the distance. It takes much farther to stop. (This is why we have reduced speed zones near schools.)


## Putting Equations Together

In the following examples, we continue to explore one-dimensional motion, but in situations requiring slightly more algebraic manipulation. The examples also give insight into problem-solving techniques. The note that follows is provided for easy reference to the equations needed. Be aware that these equations are not independent. In many situations we have two unknowns and need two equations from the set to solve for the unknowns. We need as many equations as there are unknowns to solve a given situation.

Summary of Kinematic Equations (constant $a$ )

$$
\begin{gathered}
x=x_{0}+\bar{v} t \\
\bar{v}=\frac{v_{0}+v}{2} \\
v=v_{0}+a t \\
x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \\
v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2 a\left(x-x_{0}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

Before we get into the examples, let's look at some of the equations more closely to see the behavior of acceleration at extreme values. Rearranging Equation 3.12, we have

$$
a=\frac{v-v_{0}}{t}
$$

From this we see that, for a finite time, if the difference between the initial and final velocities is small, the acceleration is small, approaching zero in the limit that the initial and final velocities are equal. On the contrary, in the limit $t \rightarrow 0$ for a finite difference between the initial and final velocities, acceleration becomes infinite.

Similarly, rearranging Equation 3.14, we can express acceleration in terms of velocities and displacement:

$$
a=\frac{v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}{2\left(x-x_{0}\right)}
$$

Thus, for a finite difference between the initial and final velocities acceleration becomes infinite in the limit the displacement approaches zero. Acceleration approaches zero in the limit the difference in initial and final velocities approaches zero for a finite displacement.

## EXAMPLE 3.10

## How Far Does a Car Go?

On dry concrete, a car can accelerate opposite to the motion at a rate of $7.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, whereas on wet concrete it can accelerate opposite to the motion at only $5.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Find the distances necessary to stop a car moving at $30.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ (about $110 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ ) on (a) dry concrete and (b) wet concrete. (c) Repeat both calculations and find the displacement from the point where the driver sees a traffic light turn red, taking into account his reaction time of $0.500 \mathrm{~s}$ to get his foot on the brake.

## Strategy

First, we need to draw a sketch Figure 3.22. To determine which equations are best to use, we need to list all the known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for.

## Solution

a. First, we need to identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that $v_{0}=30.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v=0$, and $a=-7.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ ( $a$ is negative because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take $x_{0}$ to be zero. We are looking for displacement $\Delta x$, or $x-x_{0}$.

Second, we identify the equation that will help us solve the problem. The best equation to use is

$$
v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2 a\left(x-x_{0}\right)
$$

This equation is best because it includes only one unknown, $x$. We know the values of all the other variables in this equation. (Other equations would allow us to solve for $x$, but they require us to know the stopping time, $t$, which we do not know. We could use them, but it would entail additional calculations.) Third, we rearrange the equation to solve for $x$ :

$$
x-x_{0}=\frac{v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}{2 a}
$$

and substitute the known values:

$$
x-0=\frac{0^{2}-(30.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2\left(-7.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}
$$

Thus,

$$
x=64.3 \mathrm{~m} \text { on dry concrete. }
$$

b. This part can be solved in exactly the same manner as (a). The only difference is that the acceleration is $-5.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. The result is

$$
x_{\text {wet }}=90.0 \mathrm{~m} \text { on wet concrete. }
$$

c. When the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in (a) and (b) for dry and wet concrete. So, to answer this question, we need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and then add that to the stopping time. It is reasonable to assume the velocity remains constant during the driver's reaction time.

To do this, we, again, identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that $\bar{v}=30.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, $t_{\text {reaction }}=0.500 \mathrm{~s}$, and $a_{\text {reaction }}=0$. We take $x_{0 \text {-reaction }}$ to be zero. We are looking for $x_{\text {reaction }}$.

Second, as before, we identify the best equation to use. In this case, $x=x_{0}+\bar{v} t$ works well because the only unknown value is $x$, which is what we want to solve for.

Third, we substitute the knowns to solve the equation:

$$
x=0+(30.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})(0.500 \mathrm{~s})=15.0 \mathrm{~m}
$$

This means the car travels $15.0 \mathrm{~m}$ while the driver reacts, making the total displacements in the two cases of dry and wet concrete $15.0 \mathrm{~m}$ greater than if he reacted instantly.

Last, we then add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement when braking (Figure

3.23),

$$
x_{\text {braking }}+x_{\text {reaction }}=x_{\text {total }},
$$

and find (a) to be $64.3 \mathrm{~m}+15.0 \mathrm{~m}=79.3 \mathrm{~m}$ when dry and (b) to be $90.0 \mathrm{~m}+15.0 \mathrm{~m}=105 \mathrm{~m}$ when wet.

## Significance

The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a fast-moving car. It should take longer to stop a car on wet pavement than dry. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to the displacements, but more important is the general approach to solving problems. We identify the knowns and the quantities to be determined, then find an appropriate equation. If there is more than one unknown, we need as many independent equations as there are unknowns to solve. There is often more than one way to solve a problem. The various parts of this example can, in fact, be solved by other methods, but the solutions presented here are the shortest.

## EXAMPLE 3.11

## Calculating Time

Suppose a car merges into freeway traffic on a $200-\mathrm{m}$-long ramp. If its initial velocity is $10.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and it accelerates at $2.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, how long does it take the car to travel the $200 \mathrm{~m}$ up the ramp? (Such information might be useful to a traffic engineer.)

## Strategy

First, we draw a sketch Figure 3.24. We are asked to solve for time $t$. As before, we identify the known quantities to choose a convenient physical relationship (that is, an equation with one unknown, $t$.)

## Solution

Again, we identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that $x_{0}=0$,

$v_{0}=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, a=2.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, and $x=200 \mathrm{~m}$.

We need to solve for $t$. The equation $x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ works best because the only unknown in the equation is the variable $t$, for which we need to solve. From this insight we see that when we input the knowns into the equation, we end up with a quadratic equation.

We need to rearrange the equation to solve for $t$, then substituting the knowns into the equation:

$$
200 \mathrm{~m}=0 \mathrm{~m}+(10.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}) t+\frac{1}{2}\left(2.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right) t^{2}
$$

We then simplify the equation. The units of meters cancel because they are in each term. We can get the units of seconds to cancel by taking $t=t \mathrm{~s}$, where $t$ is the magnitude of time and $\mathrm{s}$ is the unit. Doing so leaves

$$
200=10 t+t^{2}
$$

We then use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$,

$$
\begin{gathered}
t^{2}+10 t-200=0 \\
t=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}
\end{gathered}
$$

which yields two solutions: $t=10.0$ and $t=-20.0$. A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean the event happened $20 \mathrm{~s}$ before the motion began. We can discard that solution. Thus,

$$
t=10.0 \mathrm{~s}
$$

## Significance

Whenever an equation contains an unknown squared, there are two solutions. In some problems both solutions are meaningful; in others, only one solution is reasonable. The $10.0-\mathrm{s}$ answer seems reasonable for a typical freeway on-ramp.

## EXAMPLE 3.12

## Acceleration of a Spaceship

A spaceship has left Earth's orbit and is on its way to the Moon. It accelerates at $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ for $2 \mathrm{~min}$ and covers a distance of $1000 \mathrm{~km}$. What are the initial and final velocities of the spaceship?

## Strategy

We are asked to find the initial and final velocities of the spaceship. Looking at the kinematic equations, we see that one equation will not give the answer. We must use one kinematic equation to solve for one of the velocities and substitute it into another kinematic equation to get the second velocity. Thus, we solve two of the kinematic equations simultaneously.

## Solution

First we solve for $v_{0}$ using $x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
x-x_{0}=v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \\
1.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}=v_{0}(120.0 \mathrm{~s})+\frac{1}{2}\left(20.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(120.0 \mathrm{~s})^{2} \\
v_{0}=7133.3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{gathered}
$$

Then we substitute $v_{0}$ into $v=v_{0}+$ at to solve for the final velocity:

$$
v=v_{0}+a t=7133.3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}+\left(20.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(120.0 \mathrm{~s})=9533.3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

There are six variables in displacement, time, velocity, and acceleration that describe motion in one dimension. The initial conditions of a given problem can be many combinations of these variables. Because of this diversity, solutions may not be as easy as simple substitutions into one of the equations. This example illustrates that solutions to kinematics may require solving two simultaneous kinematic equations.

With the basics of kinematics established, we can go on to many other interesting examples and applications. In the process of developing kinematics, we have also glimpsed a general approach to problem solving that produces both correct answers and insights into physical relationships. The next level of complexity in our kinematics problems involves the motion of two interrelated bodies, called two-body pursuit problems.

## Two-Body Pursuit Problems

Up until this point we have looked at examples of motion involving a single body. Even for the problem with two cars and the stopping distances on wet and dry roads, we divided this problem into two separate problems to find the answers. In a two-body pursuit problem, the motions of the objects are coupled-meaning, the unknown we seek depends on the motion of both objects. To solve these problems we write the equations of motion for each object and then solve them simultaneously to find the unknown. This is illustrated in Figure 3.25.

The time and distance required for car 1 to catch car 2 depends on the initial distance car 1 is from car 2 as well as the velocities of both cars and the acceleration of car 1. The kinematic equations describing the motion of both cars must be solved to find these unknowns.

Consider the following example.

## EXAMPLE 3.13

## Cheetah Catching a Gazelle

A cheetah waits in hiding behind a bush. The cheetah spots a gazelle running past at $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. At the instant the gazelle passes the cheetah, the cheetah accelerates from rest at $4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ to catch the gazelle. (a) How long does it take the cheetah to catch the gazelle? (b) What is the displacement of the gazelle and cheetah?

## Strategy

We use the set of equations for constant acceleration to solve this problem. Since there are two objects in motion, we have separate equations of motion describing each animal. But what links the equations is a
common parameter that has the same value for each animal. If we look at the problem closely, it is clear the common parameter to each animal is their position $x$ at a later time $t$. Since they both start at $x_{0}=0$, their displacements are the same at a later time $t$, when the cheetah catches up with the gazelle. If we pick the equation of motion that solves for the displacement for each animal, we can then set the equations equal to each other and solve for the unknown, which is time.

## Solution

a. Equation for the gazelle: The gazelle has a constant velocity, which is its average velocity, since it is not accelerating. Therefore, we use Equation 3.10 with $x_{0}=0$ :

$$
x=x_{0}+\bar{v} t=\bar{v} t
$$

Equation for the cheetah: The cheetah is accelerating from rest, so we use Equation 3.13 with $x_{0}=0$ and $v_{0}=0$

$$
x=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}=\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

Now we have an equation of motion for each animal with a common parameter, which can be eliminated to find the solution. In this case, we solve for $t$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x=\bar{v} t=\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \\
& t=\frac{2 \bar{v}}{a} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The gazelle has a constant velocity of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, which is its average velocity. The acceleration of the cheetah is $4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Evaluating $t$, the time for the cheetah to reach the gazelle, we have

$$
t=\frac{2 \bar{v}}{a}=\frac{2(10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})}{4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}=5 \mathrm{~s}
$$

b. To get the displacement, we use either the equation of motion for the cheetah or the gazelle, since they should both give the same answer.

Displacement of the cheetah:

$$
x=\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(5)^{2}=50 \mathrm{~m}
$$

Displacement of the gazelle:

$$
x=\bar{v} t=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}(5)=50 \mathrm{~m}
$$

We see that both displacements are equal, as expected.

## Significance

It is important to analyze the motion of each object and to use the appropriate kinematic equations to describe the individual motion. It is also important to have a good visual perspective of the two-body pursuit problem to see the common parameter that links the motion of both objects.

### 3.5 Free Fall

An interesting application of Equation 3.4 through Equation 3.14 is called free fall, which describes the motion of an object falling in a gravitational field, such as near the surface of Earth or other celestial objects of planetary size. Let's assume the body is falling in a straight line perpendicular to the surface, so its motion is one-dimensional. For example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit the bottom. But "falling," in the context of free fall, does not necessarily imply the body is moving from a greater height to a lesser height. If a ball is thrown upward, the equations of free fall apply equally to its ascent as well as its descent.

## Gravity

The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the same constant acceleration, independent of their mass. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected because we are so accustomed to the effects of air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones. Until Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) proved otherwise, people believed that a heavier object has a greater acceleration in a free fall. We now know this is not the case. In the absence of air resistance, heavy objects arrive at the ground at the same time as lighter objects when dropped from the same height Figure 3.26.

In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall slower than a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball reaches the ground after a baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, and friction between objects-such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped-also opposes motion between them.

For the ideal situations of these first few chapters, an object falling without air resistance or friction is defined to be in free fall. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The acceleration of free-
falling objects is therefore called acceleration due to gravity. Acceleration due to gravity is constant, which means we can apply the kinematic equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens to us a broad class of interesting situations.

Acceleration due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given its own symbol, $g$. It is constant at any given location on Earth and has the average value

$$
g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\left(\text { or } 32.2 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)
$$

Although $g$ varies from $9.78 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ to $9.83 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, depending on latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations, and local topography, let's use an average value of $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ rounded to two significant figures in this text unless specified otherwise. Neglecting these effects on the value of $g$ as a result of position on Earth's surface, as well as effects resulting from Earth's rotation, we take the direction of acceleration due to gravity to be downward (toward the center of Earth). In fact, its direction defines what we call vertical. Note that whether acceleration $a$ in the kinematic equations has the value $+g$ or $-g$ depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define the upward direction as positive, then $a=-g=-9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, and if we define the downward direction as positive, then $a=g=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

## One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity

The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex ones. So, we start by considering straight up-and-down motion with no air resistance or friction. These assumptions mean the velocity (if there is any) is vertical. If an object is dropped, we know the initial velocity is zero when in free fall. When the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in free fall. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was released. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and its acceleration of $g$ is no longer valid. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude $g$. We represent vertical displacement with the symbol $y$.

## Kinematic Equations for Objects in Free Fall

We assume here that acceleration equals - $g$ (with the positive direction upward).

$$
\begin{gather*}
v=v_{0}-g t \\
y=y_{0}+v_{0} t-\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}-2 g\left(y-y_{0}\right)
\end{gather*}
$$

## PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

## Free Fall

1. Decide on the sign of the acceleration of gravity. In Equation 3.15 through Equation 3.17, acceleration $g$ is negative, which says the positive direction is upward and the negative direction is downward. In some problems, it may be useful to have acceleration $g$ as positive, indicating the positive direction is downward.
2. Draw a sketch of the problem. This helps visualize the physics involved.
3. Record the knowns and unknowns from the problem description. This helps devise a strategy for selecting the appropriate equations to solve the problem.
4. Decide which of Equation 3.15 through Equation 3.17 are to be used to solve for the unknowns.

## Free Fall of a Ball

Figure 3.27 shows the positions of a ball, at 1-s intervals, with an initial velocity of $4.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ downward, that is thrown from the top of a $98-\mathrm{m}$-high building. (a) How much time elapses before the ball reaches the ground? (b) What is the velocity when it arrives at the ground?

## Strategy

Choose the origin at the top of the building with the positive direction upward and the negative direction downward. To find the time when the position is $-98 \mathrm{~m}$, we use Equation 3.16, with $y_{0}=0, v_{0}=-4.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, and $g=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

## Solution

a. Substitute the given values into the equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y=y_{0}+v_{0} t-\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
& -98.0 \mathrm{~m}=0-(4.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}) t-\frac{1}{2}\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right) t^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This simplifies to

$$
t^{2}+t-20=0
$$

This is a quadratic equation with roots $t=-5.0 \mathrm{~s}$ and $t=4.0 \mathrm{~s}$. The positive root is the one we are interested in, since time $t=0$ is the time when the ball is released at the top of the building. (The time $t=-5.0 \mathrm{~s}$ represents the fact that a ball thrown upward from the ground would have been in the air for 5.0 $\mathrm{s}$ when it passed by the top of the building moving downward at $4.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)

b. Using Equation 3.15, we have

$$
v=v_{0}-g t=-4.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(4.0 \mathrm{~s})=-44.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

For situations when two roots are obtained from a quadratic equation in the time variable, we must look at the physical significance of both roots to determine which is correct. Since $t=0$ corresponds to the time when the ball was released, the negative root would correspond to a time before the ball was released, which is not physically meaningful. When the ball hits the ground, its velocity is not immediately zero, but as soon as the ball interacts with the ground, its acceleration is not $g$ and it accelerates with a different value over a short time to zero velocity. This problem shows how important it is to establish the correct coordinate system and to keep the signs of $g$ in the kinematic equations consistent.

## Vertical Motion of a Baseball

A batter hits a baseball straight upward at home plate and the ball is caught $5.0 \mathrm{~s}$ after it is struck Figure 3.28 . (a) What is the initial velocity of the ball? (b) What is the maximum height the ball reaches? (c) How long does it take to reach the maximum height? (d) What is the acceleration at the top of its path? (e) What is the velocity of the ball when it is caught? Assume the ball is hit and caught at the same location.

## Strategy

Choose a coordinate system with a positive $y$-axis that is straight up and with an origin that is at the spot where the ball is hit and caught.

## Solution

a. Equation 3.16 gives

$$
\begin{gathered}
y=y_{0}+v_{0} t-\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
0=0+v_{0}(5.0 \mathrm{~s})-\frac{1}{2}\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(5.0 \mathrm{~s})^{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

which gives $v_{0}=24.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

b. At the maximum height, $v=0$. With $v_{0}=24.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, Equation 3.17 gives

$$
v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}-2 g\left(y-y_{0}\right)
$$

$$
0=(24.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}-2\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(y-0)
$$

or

$$
y=30.6 \mathrm{~m}
$$

c. To find the time when $v=0$, we use Equation 3.15:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Equation } 3.15 \text { : } \\
& \qquad v=v_{0}-g t \\
& 0=24.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right) t
\end{aligned}
$$

This gives $t=2.5 \mathrm{~s}$. Since the ball rises for $2.5 \mathrm{~s}$, the time to fall is $2.5 \mathrm{~s}$.

d. The acceleration is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ everywhere, even when the velocity is zero at the top of the path. Although the velocity is zero at the top, it is changing at the rate of $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ downward.

e. The velocity at $t=5.0 \mathrm{~s}$ can be determined with Equation 3.15:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v & =v_{0}-g t \\
& =24.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}(5.0 \mathrm{~s}) \\
& =-24.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

The ball returns with the speed it had when it left. This is a general property of free fall for any initial velocity. We used a single equation to go from throw to catch, and did not have to break the motion into two segments, upward and downward. We are used to thinking that the effect of gravity is to create free fall downward toward Earth. It is important to understand, as illustrated in this example, that objects moving upward away from Earth are also in a state of free fall.

## EXAMPLE 3.16

## Rocket Booster

A small rocket with a booster blasts off and heads straight upward. When at a height of $5.0 \mathrm{~km}$ and velocity of $200.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, it releases its booster. (a) What is the maximum height the booster attains? (b) What is the velocity of the booster at a height of $6.0 \mathrm{~km}$ ? Neglect air resistance.

## Strategy

We need to select the coordinate system for the acceleration of gravity, which we take as negative downward. We are given the initial velocity of the booster and its height. We consider the point of release as the origin. We know the velocity is zero at the maximum position within the acceleration interval; thus, the velocity of the booster is zero at its maximum height, so we can use this information as well. From these observations, we use Equation 3.17, which gives us the maximum height of the booster. We also use Equation 3.17 to give the velocity at $6.0 \mathrm{~km}$. The initial velocity of the booster is $200.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

## Solution

a. From Equation 3.17, $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}-2 g\left(y-y_{0}\right)$. With $v=0$ and $y_{0}=0$, we can solve for $y$.

$$
y=\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}=\frac{\left(2.0 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\right)^{2}}{2\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}=2040.8 \mathrm{~m}
$$

This solution gives the maximum height of the booster in our coordinate system, which has its origin at the point of release, so the maximum height of the booster is roughly $7.0 \mathrm{~km}$.

b. An altitude of $6.0 \mathrm{~km}$ corresponds to $y=1.0 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m}$ in the coordinate system we are using. The other initial conditions are $y_{0}=0$, and $v_{0}=200.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

We have, from Equation 3.17,

$$
v^{2}=(200.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}-2\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)\left(1.0 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m}\right) \Rightarrow v= \pm 142.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

We have both a positive and negative solution in (b). Since our coordinate system has the positive direction upward, the $+142.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ corresponds to a positive upward velocity at $6000 \mathrm{~m}$ during the upward leg of the trajectory of the booster. The value $v=-142.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ corresponds to the velocity at $6000 \mathrm{~m}$ on the downward leg. This example is also important in that an object is given an initial velocity at the origin of our coordinate system, but the origin is at an altitude above the surface of Earth, which must be taken into account when forming the solution.

### 3.6 Finding Velocity and Displacement from Acceleration

This section assumes you have enough background in calculus to be familiar with integration. In Instantaneous Velocity and Speed and Average and Instantaneous Acceleration we introduced the kinematic functions of velocity and acceleration using the derivative. By taking the derivative of the position function we found the velocity function, and likewise by taking the derivative of the velocity function we found the acceleration function. Using integral calculus, we can work backward and calculate the velocity function from the acceleration function, and the position function from the velocity function.

## Kinematic Equations from Integral Calculus

Let's begin with a particle with an acceleration $a(t)$ which is a known function of time. Since the time derivative of the velocity function is acceleration,

$$
\frac{d}{d t} v(t)=a(t)
$$

we can take the indefinite integral of both sides, finding

$$
\int \frac{d}{d t} v(t) d t=\int a(t) d t+C_{1}
$$

where $C_{1}$ is a constant of integration. Since $\int \frac{d}{d t} v(t) d t=v(t)$, the velocity is given by

$$
v(t)=\int a(t) d t+C_{1}
$$

Similarly, the time derivative of the position function is the velocity function,

$$
\frac{d}{d t} x(t)=v(t)
$$

Thus, we can use the same mathematical manipulations we just used and find

$$
x(t)=\int v(t) d t+C_{2}
$$

where $C_{2}$ is a second constant of integration.

We can derive the kinematic equations for a constant acceleration using these integrals. With $a(t)=a$ a constant, and doing the integration in Equation 3.18, we find

$$
v(t)=\int a d t+C_{1}=a t+C_{1}
$$

If the initial velocity is $v(0)=v_{0}$, then

$$
v_{0}=0+C_{1}
$$

Then, $C_{1}=v_{0}$ and

$$
v(t)=v_{0}+a t
$$

which is Equation 3.12. Substituting this expression into Equation 3.19 gives

$$
x(t)=\int\left(v_{0}+a t\right) d t+C_{2}
$$

Doing the integration, we find

$$
x(t)=v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}+C_{2}
$$

If $x(0)=x_{0}$, we have

$$
x_{0}=0+0+C_{2}
$$

so, $C_{2}=x_{0}$. Substituting back into the equation for $x(t)$, we finally have

$$
x(t)=x_{0}+v_{0} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

which is Equation 3.13.

## Motion of a Motorboat

A motorboat is traveling at a constant velocity of $5.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ when it starts to accelerate opposite to the motion to arrive at the dock. Its acceleration is $a(t)=-\frac{1}{4} t \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{3}$. (a) What is the velocity function of the motorboat? (b) At what time does the velocity reach zero? (c) What is the position function of the motorboat? (d) What is the displacement of the motorboat from the time it begins to accelerate opposite to the motion to when the velocity is zero? (e) Graph the velocity and position functions.

## Strategy

(a) To get the velocity function we must integrate and use initial conditions to find the constant of integration.

(b) We set the velocity function equal to zero and solve for $t$. (c) Similarly, we must integrate to find the position function and use initial conditions to find the constant of integration. (d) Since the initial position is taken to be zero, we only have to evaluate the position function at the time when the velocity is zero.

## Solution

We take $t=0$ to be the time when the boat starts to accelerate opposite to the motion.

a. From the functional form of the acceleration we can solve Equation 3.18 to get $v(t)$ :

$$
v(t)=\int a(t) d t+C_{1}=\int-\frac{1}{4} t d t+C_{1}=-\frac{1}{8} t^{2}+C_{1}
$$

At $t=0$ we have $v(0)=5.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=0+C_{1}$, so $C_{1}=5.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ or $v(t)=5.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-\frac{1}{8} t^{2}$.
b. $v(t)=0=5.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-\frac{1}{8} t^{2} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{3} \Rightarrow t=6.3 \mathrm{~s}$

c. Solve Equation 3.19:

$$
x(t)=\int v(t) d t+C_{2}=\int\left(5.0-\frac{1}{8} t^{2}\right) d t+C_{2}=5.0 t \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-\frac{1}{24} t^{3} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{3}+C_{2}
$$

At $t=0$, we set $x(0)=0=x_{0}$, since we are only interested in the displacement from when the boat starts to accelerate opposite to the motion. We have

$$
x(0)=0=C_{2}
$$

Therefore, the equation for the position is

$$
x(t)=5.0 t-\frac{1}{24} t^{3}
$$

d. Since the initial position is taken to be zero, we only have to evaluate the position function at the time when the velocity is zero. This occurs at $t=6.3 \mathrm{~s}$. Therefore, the displacement is

$$
x(6.3)=5.0(6.3 \mathrm{~s})-\frac{1}{24}(6.3 \mathrm{~s})^{3}=21.1 \mathrm{~m}
$$

## Significance

The acceleration function is linear in time so the integration involves simple polynomials. In Figure 3.30, we see that if we extend the solution beyond the point when the velocity is zero, the velocity becomes negative and the boat reverses direction. This tells us that solutions can give us information outside our immediate interest and we should be careful when interpreting them.
