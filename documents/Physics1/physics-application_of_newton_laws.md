# CHAPTER 6 Applications of Newton's Laws 

INTRODUCTION Car racing has grown in popularity in recent years. As each car moves in a curved path around the turn, its wheels also spin rapidly. The wheels complete many revolutions while the car makes only part of one (a circular arc). How can we describe the velocities, accelerations, and forces involved? What force keeps a racecar from spinning out, hitting the wall bordering the track? What provides this force? Why is the track banked? We answer all of these questions in this chapter as we expand our consideration of Newton's laws of motion.

### 6.1 Solving Problems with Newton's Laws

Success in problem solving is necessary to understand and apply physical principles. We developed a pattern of analyzing and setting up the solutions to problems involving Newton's laws in Newton's Laws of Motion; in this chapter, we continue to discuss these strategies and apply a step-by-step process.

## Problem-Solving Strategies

We follow here the basics of problem solving presented earlier in this text, but we emphasize specific strategies that are useful in applying Newton's laws of motion. Once you identify the physical principles involved in the problem and determine that they include Newton's laws of motion, you can apply these steps to find a solution. These techniques also reinforce concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. Many problem-solving strategies are stated outright in the worked examples, so the following techniques should reinforce skills you have already begun to develop.

## PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

## Applying Newton's Laws of Motion

1. Identify the physical principles involved by listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated.
2. Sketch the situation, using arrows to represent all forces.
3. Determine the system of interest. The result is a free-body diagram that is essential to solving the problem.
4. Apply Newton's second law to solve the problem. If necessary, apply appropriate kinematic equations from the chapter on motion along a straight line.
5. Check the solution to see whether it is reasonable.

Let's apply this problem-solving strategy to the challenge of lifting a grand piano into a second-story apartment. Once we have determined that Newton's laws of motion are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is particularly important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. Such a sketch is shown in Figure 6.2(a). Then, as in Figure 6.2(b), we can represent all forces with arrows. Whenever sufficient information exists, it is best to label these arrows carefully and make the length and direction of each correspond to the represented force.

As with most problems, we next need to identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be inferred from the problem as stated, that is, make a list of knowns and unknowns. It is particularly crucial to identify the system of interest, since Newton's second law involves only external forces. We can then determine which forces are external and which are internal, a necessary step to employ Newton's second law. (See Figure 6.2(c).) Newton's third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted between components of a system (internal) or between the system and something outside (external). As illustrated in Newton's Laws of Motion, the system of interest depends on the question we need to answer. Only forces are shown in free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. We have drawn several free-body diagrams in previous worked examples. Figure 6.2(c) shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal forces are shown in a free-body diagram.

Once a free-body diagram is drawn, we apply Newton's second law. This is done in Figure 6.2(d) for a particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly identified in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all previous examples. If the problem is one-dimensional-that is, if all forces are parallel-then the forces can be handled algebraically. If the problem is two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of one-dimensional problems. We do this by projecting the force vectors onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples, the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an incline is involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline and one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this is known. Generally, just write Newton's second law in components along the different directions. Then, you have the following equations:

$$
\sum F_{x}=m a_{x}, \quad \sum F_{y}=m a_{y}
$$

(If, for example, the system is accelerating horizontally, then you can then set $a_{y}=0$.) We need this information to determine unknown forces acting on a system.

As always, we must check the solution. In some cases, it is easy to tell whether the solution is reasonable. For example, it is reasonable to find that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than when no friction exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually through problem solving; with experience, it
becomes progressively easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check a solution is to check the units. If we are solving for force and end up with units of millimeters per second, then we have made a mistake.

There are many interesting applications of Newton's laws of motion, a few more of which are presented in this section. These serve also to illustrate some further subtleties of physics and to help build problem-solving skills. We look first at problems involving particle equilibrium, which make use of Newton's first law, and then consider particle acceleration, which involves Newton's second law.

## Particle Equilibrium

Recall that a particle in equilibrium is one for which the external forces are balanced. Static equilibrium involves objects at rest, and dynamic equilibrium involves objects in motion without acceleration, but it is important to remember that these conditions are relative. For example, an object may be at rest when viewed from our frame of reference, but the same object would appear to be in motion when viewed by someone moving at a constant velocity. We now make use of the knowledge attained in Newton's Laws of Motion, regarding the different types of forces and the use of free-body diagrams, to solve additional problems in particle equilibrium.

## EXAMPLE 6.1

## Different Tensions at Different Angles

Consider the traffic light (mass of $15.0 \mathrm{~kg}$ ) suspended from two wires as shown in Figure 6.3. Find the tension in each wire, neglecting the masses of the wires.

## Strategy

The system of interest is the traffic light, and its free-body diagram is shown in Figure 6.3(c). The three forces involved are not parallel, and so they must be projected onto a coordinate system. The most convenient coordinate system has one axis vertical and one horizontal, and the vector projections on it are shown in Figure 6.3(d). There are two unknowns in this problem $\left(T_{1}\right.$ and $\left.T_{2}\right)$, so two equations are needed to find them. These two equations come from applying Newton's second law along the vertical and horizontal axes, noting that the net external force is zero along each axis because acceleration is zero.

## Solution

First consider the horizontal or $x$-axis:

$$
F_{\text {net } x}=T_{2 x}+T_{1 x}=0
$$

Thus, as you might expect,

$$
\left|T_{1 x}\right|=\left|T_{2 x}\right|
$$

This gives us the following relationship:

$$
T_{1} \cos 30^{\circ}=T_{2} \cos 45^{\circ}
$$

Thus,

$$
T_{2}=1.225 T_{1}
$$

Note that $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are not equal in this case because the angles on either side are not equal. It is reasonable that $T_{2}$ ends up being greater than $T_{1}$ because it is exerted more vertically than $T_{1}$.

Now consider the force components along the vertical or $y$-axis:

$$
F_{\text {net } y}=T_{1 y}+T_{2 y}-w=0
$$

This implies

$$
T_{1 y}+T_{2 y}=w
$$

Substituting the expressions for the vertical components gives

$$
T_{1} \sin 30^{\circ}+T_{2} \sin 45^{\circ}=w
$$

There are two unknowns in this equation, but substituting the expression for $T_{2}$ in terms of $T_{1}$ reduces this to one equation with one unknown:

$$
T_{1}(0.500)+\left(1.225 T_{1}\right)(0.707)=w=m g
$$

which yields

$$
1.366 T_{1}=(15.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)
$$

Solving this last equation gives the magnitude of $T_{1}$ to be

$$
T_{1}=108 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Finally, we find the magnitude of $T_{2}$ by using the relationship between them, $T_{2}=1.225 T_{1}$, found above. Thus we obtain

$$
T_{2}=132 \mathrm{~N}
$$

## Significance

Both tensions would be larger if both wires were more horizontal, and they will be equal if and only if the angles on either side are the same (as they were in the earlier example of a tightrope walker in Newton's Laws of Motion.

## Particle Acceleration

We have given a variety of examples of particles in equilibrium. We now turn our attention to particle acceleration problems, which are the result of a nonzero net force. Refer again to the steps given at the beginning of this section, and notice how they are applied to the following examples.

## EXAMPLE 6.2

## Drag Force on a Barge

Two tugboats push on a barge at different angles (Figure 6.4). The first tugboat exerts a force of $2.7 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}$ in the $x$-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of $3.6 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}$ in the $y$-direction. The mass of the barge is $5.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~kg}$ and its acceleration is observed to be $7.5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ in the direction shown. What is the drag force of the water on the barge resisting the motion? (Note: Drag force is a frictional force exerted by fluids, such as air or water. The drag force opposes the motion of the object. Since the barge is flat bottomed, we can assume that the drag force is in the direction opposite of motion of the barge.)

## Strategy

The directions and magnitudes of acceleration and the applied forces are given in Figure 6.4(a). We define the total force of the tugboats on the barge as $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$ so that

$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{app}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{1}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{2}
$$

The drag of the water $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {D }}$ is in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the boat; this force thus works against $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$, as shown in the free-body diagram in Figure 6.4(b). The system of interest here is the barge, since the forces on it are given as well as its acceleration. Because the applied forces are perpendicular, the $x$ - and $y$-axes are in the same direction as $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{1}$ and $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{2}$. The problem quickly becomes a one-dimensional problem along the direction of $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$, since friction is in the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$. Our strategy is to find the magnitude and direction of the net applied force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$ and then apply Newton's second law to solve for the drag force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{D}}$.

## Solution

Since $F_{x}$ and $F_{y}$ are perpendicular, we can find the magnitude and direction of $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$ directly. First, the resultant magnitude is given by the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
F_{\mathrm{app}}=\sqrt{F_{1}^{2}+F_{2}^{2}}=\sqrt{\left(2.7 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}\right)^{2}+\left(3.6 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}\right)^{2}}=4.5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}
$$

The angle is given by

$$
\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{F_{2}}{F_{1}}\right)=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{3.6 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}}{2.7 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}}\right)=53.1^{\circ}
$$

From Newton's first law, we know this is the same direction as the acceleration. We also know that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{D}}$ is in the opposite direction of $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$, since it acts to slow down the acceleration. Therefore, the net external force is in the same direction as $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$, but its magnitude is slightly less than $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$. The problem is now one-dimensional. From the free-body diagram, we can see that

$$
F_{\text {net }}=F_{\text {app }}-F_{\mathrm{D}}
$$

However, Newton's second law states that

$$
F_{\text {net }}=m a
$$

Thus,

$$
F_{\mathrm{app}}-F_{\mathrm{D}}=m a
$$

This can be solved for the magnitude of the drag force of the water $F_{\mathrm{D}}$ in terms of known quantities:

$$
F_{\mathrm{D}}=F_{\mathrm{app}}-m a
$$

Substituting known values gives

$$
F_{\mathrm{D}}=\left(4.5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N}\right)-\left(5.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~kg}\right)\left(7.5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=7.5 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~N}
$$

The direction of $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{D}}$ has already been determined to be in the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {app }}$, or at an angle of $53^{\circ}$ south of west.

## Significance

The numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large barge. It is certainly difficult to obtain larger accelerations with tugboats, and small speeds are desirable to avoid running the barge into the docks. Drag is relatively small for a well-designed hull at low speeds, consistent with the answer to this example, where $F_{\mathrm{D}}$ is less than $1 / 600$ th of the weight of the ship.

In Newton's Laws of Motion, we discussed the normal force, which is a contact force that acts normal to the surface so that an object does not have an acceleration perpendicular to the surface. The bathroom scale is an excellent example of a normal force acting on a body. It provides a quantitative reading of how much it must push upward to support the weight of an object. But can you predict what you would see on the dial of a bathroom scale if you stood on it during an elevator ride? Will you see a value greater than your weight when the elevator starts up? What about when the elevator moves upward at a constant speed? Take a guess before reading the next example.

## EXAMPLE 6.3

## What Does the Bathroom Scale Read in an Elevator?

Figure 6.5 shows a $75.0-\mathrm{kg}$ man (weight of about $165 \mathrm{lb}$.) standing on a bathroom scale in an elevator. Calculate the scale reading: (a) if the elevator accelerates upward at a rate of $1.20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, and (b) if the elevator moves upward at a constant speed of $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

## Strategy

If the scale at rest is accurate, its reading equals $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{p}}$, the magnitude of the force the person exerts downward on it. Figure 6.5(a) shows the numerous forces acting on the elevator, scale, and person. It makes this onedimensional problem look much more formidable than if the person is chosen to be the system of interest and a free-body diagram is drawn, as in Figure 6.5(b). Analysis of the free-body diagram using Newton's laws can produce answers to both Figure 6.5(a) and (b) of this example, as well as some other questions that might arise. The only forces acting on the person are his weight $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{w}}$ and the upward force of the scale $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{s}}$. According to Newton's third law, $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{s}}$ are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so that we need to find $F_{\mathrm{s}}$ in order to find what the scale reads. We can do this, as usual, by applying Newton's second law,

$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {net }}=m \overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}
$$

From the free-body diagram, we see that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\text {net }}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{s}-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{w}}$, so we have

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}-w=m a
$$

Solving for $F_{S}$ gives us an equation with only one unknown:

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=m a+w
$$

or, because $w=m g$, simply

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=m a+m g
$$

No assumptions were made about the acceleration, so this solution should be valid for a variety of accelerations in addition to those in this situation. (Note: We are considering the case when the elevator is accelerating upward. If the elevator is accelerating downward, Newton's second law becomes $F_{s}-w=-m a$.)

## Solution

a. We have $a=1.20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, so that

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=(75.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)+(75.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(1.20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)
$$

yielding

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=825 \mathrm{~N}
$$

b. Now, what happens when the elevator reaches a constant upward velocity? Will the scale still read more than his weight? For any constant velocity-up, down, or stationary-acceleration is zero because $a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ and $\Delta v=0$. Thus,

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=m a+m g=0+m g
$$

or

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=(75.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)
$$

which gives

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=735 \mathrm{~N}
$$

## Significance

The scale reading in Figure 6.5 (a) is about 185 lb. What would the scale have read if he were stationary? Since his acceleration would be zero, the force of the scale would be equal to his weight:

$$
\begin{gathered}
F_{\text {net }}=m a=0=F_{\mathrm{s}}-w \\
F_{\mathrm{s}}=w=m g \\
F_{\mathrm{S}}=(75.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=735 \mathrm{~N}
\end{gathered}
$$

Thus, the scale reading in the elevator is greater than his $735-\mathrm{N}(165-1 \mathrm{lb})$ weight. This means that the scale is pushing up on the person with a force greater than his weight, as it must in order to accelerate him upward. Clearly, the greater the acceleration of the elevator, the greater the scale reading, consistent with what you feel in rapidly accelerating versus slowly accelerating elevators. In Figure 6.5(b), the scale reading is $735 \mathrm{~N}$, which equals the person's weight. This is the case whenever the elevator has a constant velocity-moving up, moving down, or stationary.

## EXAMPLE 6.4

## Two Attached Blocks

Figure 6.6 shows a block of mass $m_{1}$ on a frictionless, horizontal surface. It is pulled by a light string that passes over a frictionless and massless pulley. The other end of the string is connected to a block of mass $m_{2}$. Find the acceleration of the blocks and the tension in the string in terms of $m_{1}, m_{2}$, and $g$.

## Strategy

We draw a free-body diagram for each mass separately, as shown in Figure 6.6. Then we analyze each one to find the required unknowns. The forces on block 1 are the gravitational force, the contact force of the surface, and the tension in the string. Block 2 is subjected to the gravitational force and the string tension. Newton's second law applies to each, so we write two vector equations:

For block 1: $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{T}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{w}}_{1}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{N}}=m_{1} \overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}_{1}$

For block $2: \overrightarrow{\mathbf{T}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{w}}_{2}=m_{2} \overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}_{2}$.

Notice that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{T}}$ is the same for both blocks. Since the string and the pulley have negligible mass, and since there is no friction in the pulley, the tension is the same throughout the string. We can now write component equations for each block. All forces are either horizontal or vertical, so we can use the same horizontal/vertical coordinate system for both objects

## Solution

The component equations follow from the vector equations above. We see that block 1 has the vertical forces balanced, so we ignore them and write an equation relating the $x$-components. There are no horizontal forces on block 2, so only the $y$-equation is written. We obtain these results:

| Block 1 | Block 2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\sum F_{x}=m a_{x}$ | $\sum F_{y}=m a_{y}$ |
| $T_{x}=m_{1} a_{1 x}$ | $T_{y}-m_{2} g=m_{2} a_{2 y}$. |

When block 1 moves to the right, block 2 travels an equal distance downward; thus, $a_{1 x}=-a_{2 y}$. Writing the common acceleration of the blocks as $a=a_{1 x}=-a_{2 y}$, we now have

$$
T=m_{1} a
$$

and

$$
T-m_{2} g=-m_{2} a
$$

From these two equations, we can express $a$ and $T$ in terms of the masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, and $g$ :

$$
a=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} g
$$

and

$$
T=\frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} g
$$

## Significance

Notice that the tension in the string is less than the weight of the block hanging from the end of it. A common error in problems like this is to set $T=m_{2} g$. You can see from the free-body diagram of block 2 that cannot be correct if the block is accelerating.

## EXAMPLE 6.5

## Atwood Machine

A classic problem in physics, similar to the one we just solved, is that of the Atwood machine, which consists of a rope running over a pulley, with two objects of different mass attached. It is particularly useful in understanding the connection between force and motion. In Figure $6.7, m_{1}=2.00 \mathrm{~kg}$ and $m_{2}=4.00 \mathrm{~kg}$. Consider the pulley to be frictionless. (a) If $m_{2}$ is released, what will its acceleration be? (b) What is the tension in the string?

## Strategy

We draw a free-body diagram for each mass separately, as shown in the figure. Then we analyze each diagram to find the required unknowns. This may involve the solution of simultaneous equations. It is also important to note the similarity with the previous example. As block 2 accelerates with acceleration $a_{2}$ in the downward direction, block 1 accelerates upward with acceleration $a_{1}$. Thus, $a=a_{1}=-a_{2}$.

## Solution

a. We have

$$
\text { For } m_{1}, \sum F_{y}=T-m_{1} g=m_{1} a . \quad \text { For } m_{2}, \sum F_{y}=T-m_{2} g=-m_{2} a
$$

(The negative sign in front of $m_{2} a$ indicates that $m_{2}$ accelerates downward; both blocks accelerate at the same rate, but in opposite directions.) Solve the two equations simultaneously (subtract them) and the result is

$$
\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right) g=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) a
$$

Solving for a:

$$
a=\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} g=\frac{4 \mathrm{~kg}-2 \mathrm{~kg}}{4 \mathrm{~kg}+2 \mathrm{~kg}}\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=3.27 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}
$$

b. Observing the first block, we see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T-m_{1} g=m_{1} a \\
& T=m_{1}(g+a)=(2 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}+3.27 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=26.1 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

The result for the acceleration given in the solution can be interpreted as the ratio of the unbalanced force on the system, $\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right) g$, to the total mass of the system, $m_{1}+m_{2}$. We can also use the Atwood machine to measure local gravitational field strength.

## Newton's Laws of Motion and Kinematics

Physics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general situations that involve more than a narrow set of physical principles. Newton's laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that have been discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion. For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of kinematics, and hence the relevance of earlier chapters.

When approaching problems that involve various types of forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or position, listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated will allow you to identify the principles involved. Then, you can refer to the chapters that deal with a particular topic and solve the problem using strategies outlined in the text. The following worked example illustrates how the problem-solving strategy given earlier in this chapter, as well as strategies presented in other chapters, is applied to an integrated concept problem.

## EXAMPLE 6.6

## What Force Must a Soccer Player Exert to Reach Top Speed?

A soccer player starts at rest and accelerates forward, reaching a velocity of $8.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in $2.50 \mathrm{~s}$. (a) What is her average acceleration? (b) What average force does the ground exert forward on the runner so that she achieves this acceleration? The player's mass is $70.0 \mathrm{~kg}$, and air resistance is negligible.

## Strategy

To find the answers to this problem, we use the problem-solving strategy given earlier in this chapter. The solutions to each part of the example illustrate how to apply specific problem-solving steps. In this case, we do not need to use all of the steps. We simply identify the physical principles, and thus the knowns and unknowns; apply Newton's second law; and check to see whether the answer is reasonable.

## Solution

a. We are given the initial and final velocities (zero and $8.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ forward); thus, the change in velocity is $\Delta v=8.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. We are given the elapsed time, so $\Delta t=2.50 \mathrm{~s}$. The unknown is acceleration, which can be found from its definition:

$$
a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$

Substituting the known values yields

$$
a=\frac{8.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{2.50 \mathrm{~s}}=3.20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}
$$

b. Here we are asked to find the average force the ground exerts on the runner to produce this acceleration. (Remember that we are dealing with the force or forces acting on the object of interest.) This is the reaction force to that exerted by the player backward against the ground, by Newton's third law. Neglecting air resistance, this would be equal in magnitude to the net external force on the player, since this force causes her acceleration. Since we now know the player's acceleration and are given her mass, we can use Newton's second law to find the force exerted. That is,

$$
F_{\text {net }}=m a
$$

Substituting the known values of $m$ and a gives

$$
F_{\text {net }}=(70.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(3.20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=224 \mathrm{~N}
$$

This is a reasonable result: The acceleration is attainable for an athlete in good condition. The force is about 50 pounds, a reasonable average force.

## Significance

This example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that include topics from different chapters. The first step is to identify the physical principles, the knowns, and the unknowns involved in the problem. The second step is to solve for the unknown, in this case using Newton's second law. Finally, we check our answer to ensure it is reasonable. These techniques for integrated concept problems will be useful in applications of physics outside of a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life.

## EXAMPLE 6.7

## What Force Acts on a Model Helicopter?

A $1.50-\mathrm{kg}$ model helicopter has a velocity of $5.00 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ at $t=0$. It is accelerated at a constant rate for two seconds $(2.00 \mathrm{~s})$ after which it has a velocity of $(6.00 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+12.00 \hat{\mathbf{j}}) \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the helicopter during this time interval?

## Strategy

We can easily set up a coordinate system in which the $x$-axis ( $\hat{\mathbf{i}}$ direction) is horizontal, and the $y$-axis ( $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$ direction $)$ is vertical. We know that $\Delta t=2.00 \mathrm{~s}$ and $\Delta v=(6.00 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+12.00 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})-(5.00 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})$. From this, we can calculate the acceleration by the definition; we can then apply Newton's second law.

## Solution

We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{(6.00 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+12.00 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})-(5.00 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})}{2.00 \mathrm{~s}}=3.00 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+3.50 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
& \sum \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=m \overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}=(1.50 \mathrm{~kg})\left(3.00 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+3.50 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=4.50 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+5.25 \hat{\mathbf{j}} \mathrm{N}
\end{aligned}
$$

The magnitude of the force is now easily found:

$$
F=\sqrt{(4.50 \mathrm{~N})^{2}+(5.25 \mathrm{~N})^{2}}=6.91 \mathrm{~N}
$$

## Significance

The original problem was stated in terms of $\hat{\mathbf{i}}-\hat{\mathbf{j}}$ vector components, so we used vector methods. Compare this example with the previous example.

## EXAMPLE 6.8

## Baggage Tractor

Figure 6.8(a) shows a baggage tractor pulling luggage carts from an airplane. The tractor has mass $650.0 \mathrm{~kg}$, while cart A has mass $250.0 \mathrm{~kg}$ and cart B has mass $150.0 \mathrm{~kg}$. The driving force acting for a brief period of time accelerates the system from rest and acts for $3.00 \mathrm{~s}$. (a) If this driving force is given by $F=(820.0 t) \mathrm{N}$, find the speed after 3.00 seconds. (b) What is the horizontal force acting on the connecting cable between the tractor and cart A at this instant?

## Strategy

A free-body diagram shows the driving force of the tractor, which gives the system its acceleration. We only need to consider motion in the horizontal direction. The vertical forces balance each other and it is not necessary to consider them. For part b, we make use of a free-body diagram of the tractor alone to determine the force between it and cart A. This exposes the coupling force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{T}}$, which is our objective.

## Solution

a. $\sum F_{x}=m_{\mathrm{system}} a_{x}$ and $\sum F_{x}=820.0 t$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
820.0 t & =(650.0+250.0+150.0) a \\
a & =0.7809 t .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since acceleration is a function of time, we can determine the velocity of the tractor by using $a=\frac{d v}{d t}$ with the initial condition that $v_{0}=0$ at $t=0$. We integrate from $t=0$ to $t=3$ :

$$
\left.d v=a d t, \quad \int_{0}^{3} d v=\int_{0}^{3.00} a d t=\int_{0}^{3.00} 0.7809 t d t, \quad v=0.3905 t^{2}\right]_{0}^{3.00}=3.51 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

b. Refer to the free-body diagram in Figure 6.8(b).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_{x} & =m_{\text {tractor }} a_{x} \\
820.0 t-T & =m_{\text {tractor }}(0.7805) t \\
(820.0)(3.00)-T & =(650.0)(0.7805)(3.00) \\
T & =938 \mathrm{~N} .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

Since the force varies with time, we must use calculus to solve this problem. Notice how the total mass of the system was important in solving Figure 6.8(a), whereas only the mass of the truck (since it supplied the force) was of use in Figure 6.8(b).

Recall that $v=\frac{d s}{d t}$ and $a=\frac{d v}{d t}$. If acceleration is a function of time, we can use the calculus forms developed in Motion Along a Straight Line, as shown in this example. However, sometimes acceleration is a function of displacement. In this case, we can derive an important result from these calculus relations. Solving for $d t$ in each, we have $d t=\frac{d s}{v}$ and $d t=\frac{d v}{a}$. Now, equating these expressions, we have $\frac{d s}{v}=\frac{d v}{a}$. We can rearrange this to obtain $a d s=v d v$.

## EXAMPLE 6.9

## Motion of a Projectile Fired Vertically

A 10.0-kg mortar shell is fired vertically upward from the ground, with an initial velocity of $50.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ (see Figure 6.9). Determine the maximum height it will travel if atmospheric resistance is measured as $F_{\mathrm{D}}=\left(0.0100 v^{2}\right) \mathrm{N}$, where $v$ is the speed at any instant.

## Strategy

The known force on the mortar shell can be related to its acceleration using the equations of motion.

Kinematics can then be used to relate the mortar shell's acceleration to its position.

## Solution

Initially, $y_{0}=0$ and $v_{0}=50.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. At the maximum height $y=h, v=0$. The free-body diagram shows $F_{\mathrm{D}}$ to act downward, because it slows the upward motion of the mortar shell. Thus, we can write

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_{y} & =m a_{y} \\
-F_{\mathrm{D}}-w & =m a_{y} \\
-0.0100 v^{2}-98.0 & =10.0 a \\
a & =-0.00100 v^{2}-9.80
\end{aligned}
$$

The acceleration depends on $v$ and is therefore variable. Since $a=f(v)$, we can relate a to $v$ using the rearrangement described above,

$$
a d s=v d v
$$

We replace $d s$ with $d y$ because we are dealing with the vertical direction,

$$
a d y=v d v, \quad\left(-0.00100 v^{2}-9.80\right) d y=v d v
$$

We now separate the variables (v's and $d v$ 's on one side; $d y$ on the other):

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \int_{0}^{h} d y=\int_{50.0}^{0} \frac{v d v}{\left(-0.00100 v^{2}-9.80\right)} \\
& \int_{0}^{h} d y=-\int_{50.0}^{0} \frac{v d v}{\left(0.00100 v^{2}+9.80\right)}=\left.\left(-5 \times 10^{3}\right) \ln \left(0.00100 v^{2}+9.80\right)\right|_{50.0} ^{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $h=114 \mathrm{~m}$.

## Significance

Notice the need to apply calculus since the force is not constant, which also means that acceleration is not constant. To make matters worse, the force depends on $v$ (not $t$ ), and so we must use the trick explained prior to the example. The answer for the height indicates a lower elevation if there were air resistance. We will deal with the effects of air resistance and other drag forces in greater detail in Drag Force and Terminal Speed.

### 6.2 Friction

When a body is in motion, it has resistance because the body interacts with its surroundings. This resistance is a force of friction. Friction opposes relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move, a concept that becomes obvious if you try to walk on ice. Friction is a common yet complex force, and its behavior still not completely understood. Still, it is possible to understand the circumstances in which it behaves.

## Static and Kinetic Friction

The basic definition of friction is relatively simple to state.

## Friction

Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in contact.

There are several forms of friction. One of the simpler characteristics of sliding friction is that it is parallel to the contact surfaces between systems and is always in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. When objects are stationary, static friction can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between two objects.

## Static and Kinetic Friction

If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to one another, then the friction between them is called static friction. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction.

Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor-you might push very hard on the crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do-it increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. If you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Now static friction gives way to kinetic friction. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic frictional force is less than the static frictional force. If you add mass to the crate, say by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going (as you might expect).

Figure 6.10 is a crude pictorial representation of how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up inspection of these surfaces shows them to be rough. Thus, when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact and is a complicated
aspect of surface physics. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact (fewer molecules adhering), so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static situations (static friction), the other for situations involving motion (kinetic friction). What follows is an approximate empirical (experimentally determined) model only. These equations for static and kinetic friction are not vector equations.

## Magnitude of Static Friction

The magnitude of static friction $f_{\mathrm{s}}$ is

$$
f_{\mathrm{s}} \leq \mu_{\mathrm{s}} N
$$

where $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the coefficient of static friction and $N$ is the magnitude of the normal force.

The symbol $\leq$ means less than or equal to, implying that static friction can have a maximum value of $\mu_{\mathrm{S}} N$. Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds

$f_{\mathrm{s}}(\max )$, the object moves. Thus,

$$
f_{\mathrm{s}}(\max )=\mu_{\mathrm{s}} N
$$

## Magnitude of Kinetic Friction

The magnitude of kinetic friction $f_{\mathrm{k}}$ is given by

$$
f_{\mathrm{k}}=\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N
$$

where $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

A system in which $f_{\mathrm{k}}=\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N$ is described as a system in which friction behaves simply. The transition from static friction to kinetic friction is illustrated in Figure 6.11.

As you can see in Table 6.1, the coefficients of kinetic friction are less than their static counterparts. The approximate values of $\mu$ are stated to only one or two digits to indicate the approximate description of friction given by the preceding two equations.

| System | Static Friction $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$ | Kinetic Friction $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rubber on dry concrete | 1.0 | 0.7 |
| Rubber on wet concrete | $0.5-0.7$ | $0.3-0.5$ |
| Wood on wood | 0.5 | 0.3 |
| Waxed wood on wet snow | 0.14 | 0.1 |
| Metal on wood | 0.5 | 0.3 |
| Steel on steel (dry) | 0.6 | 0.3 |
| Steel on steel (oiled) | 0.05 | 0.03 |
| Teflon on steel | 0.04 | 0.04 |
| Bone lubricated by synovial fluid | 0.016 | 0.015 |
| Shoes on wood | 0.9 | 0.7 |
| Shoes on ice | 0.1 | 0.05 |
| Ice on ice | 0.1 | 0.03 |
| Steel on ice | 0.4 | 0.02 |

Table 6.1 Approximate Coefficients of Static and Kinetic Friction

Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 include the dependence of friction on materials and the normal force. The direction of friction is always opposite that of motion, parallel to the surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal force. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of $100 \mathrm{~kg}$, then the normal force is equal to its weight,

$$
w=m g=(100 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=980 \mathrm{~N}
$$

perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45 , you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than

$$
f_{\mathrm{s}}(\max )=\mu_{\mathrm{s}} N=(0.45)(980 \mathrm{~N})=440 \mathrm{~N}
$$

to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30 , so that a force of only

$$
f_{\mathrm{k}}=\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N=(0.30)(980 \mathrm{~N})=290 \mathrm{~N}
$$

keeps it moving at a constant speed. If the floor is lubricated, both coefficients are considerably less than they would be without lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unitless quantity with a magnitude usually between 0 and 1.0. The actual value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.

Many people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice. However, many parts of the body, especially the joints, have much smaller coefficients of friction-often three or four times less than ice. A joint is formed by the ends of two bones, which are connected by thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by the lower leg bone (the tibia) and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost-
glassy surface. The joints also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced by an artificial joint (Figure 6.12). These replacements can be made of metals (stainless steel or titanium) or plastic (polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.

Natural lubricants include saliva produced in our mouths to aid in the swallowing process, and the slippery mucus found between organs in the body, allowing them to move freely past each other during heartbeats, during breathing, and when a person moves. Hospitals and doctor's clinics commonly use artificial lubricants, such as gels, to reduce friction.

The equations given for static and kinetic friction are empirical laws that describe the behavior of the forces of friction. While these formulas are very useful for practical purposes, they do not have the status of mathematical statements that represent general principles (e.g., Newton's second law). In fact, there are cases for which these equations are not even good approximations. For instance, neither formula is accurate for lubricated surfaces or for two surfaces siding across each other at high speeds. Unless specified, we will not be concerned with these exceptions.

EXAMPLE 6.10

## Static and Kinetic Friction

A $20.0-\mathrm{kg}$ crate is at rest on a floor as shown in Figure 6.13. The coefficient of static friction between the crate and floor is 0.700 and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.600 . A horizontal force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}$ is applied to the crate. Find the force of friction if (a) $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=20.0 \mathrm{Ni}$, (b) $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=30.0 \mathrm{Ni}$, (c) $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=120.0 \mathrm{Ni}$, and (d) $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=180.0 \mathrm{Ni}$.

## Strategy

The free-body diagram of the crate is shown in Figure 6.13(b). We apply Newton's second law in the horizontal and vertical directions, including the friction force in opposition to the direction of motion of the box.

## Solution

Newton's second law GIVES

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\sum F_{x}=m a_{x} & \sum F_{y}=m a_{y} \\
P-f=m a_{x} & N-w=0
\end{array}
$$

Here we are using the symbol $f$ to represent the frictional force since we have not yet determined whether the crate is subject to station friction or kinetic friction. We do this whenever we are unsure what type of friction is acting. Now the weight of the crate is

$$
w=(20.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=196 \mathrm{~N}
$$

which is also equal to $N$. The maximum force of static friction is therefore $(0.700)(196 \mathrm{~N})=137 \mathrm{~N}$. As long as $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}$ is less than $137 \mathrm{~N}$, the force of static friction keeps the crate stationary and $f_{\mathrm{s}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}$. Thus, (a) $f_{s}=20.0 \mathrm{~N}$, (b) $f_{s}=30.0 \mathrm{~N}$, and (c) $f_{s}=120.0 \mathrm{~N}$.

(d) If $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=180.0 \mathrm{~N}$, the applied force is greater than the maximum force of static friction ( $137 \mathrm{~N}$ ), so the crate can no longer remain at rest. Once the crate is in motion, kinetic friction acts. Then

$$
f_{\mathrm{k}}=\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N=(0.600)(196 \mathrm{~N})=118 \mathrm{~N}
$$

and the acceleration is

$$
a_{x}=\frac{\mathrm{P}-f_{\mathrm{k}}}{m}=\frac{180.0 \mathrm{~N}-118 \mathrm{~N}}{20.0 \mathrm{~kg}}=3.10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}
$$

## Significance

This example illustrates how we consider friction in a dynamics problem. Notice that static friction has a value that matches the applied force, until we reach the maximum value of static friction. Also, no motion can occur until the applied force equals the force of static friction, but the force of kinetic friction will then become smaller.

## Friction and the Inclined Plane

One situation where friction plays an obvious role is that of an object on a slope. It might be a crate being pushed up a ramp to a loading dock or a skateboarder coasting down a mountain, but the basic physics is the same. We usually generalize the sloping surface and call it an inclined plane but then pretend that the surface is flat. Let's look at an example of analyzing motion on an inclined plane with friction.

## EXAMPLE 6.11

## Downhill Skier

A skier with a mass of $62 \mathrm{~kg}$ is sliding down a snowy slope at a constant acceleration. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier if friction is known to be $45.0 \mathrm{~N}$.

## Strategy

The magnitude of kinetic friction is given as $45.0 \mathrm{~N}$. Kinetic friction is related to the normal force $N$ by $f_{\mathrm{k}}=\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N$; thus, we can find the coefficient of kinetic friction if we can find the normal force on the skier. The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal force should equal the component of the skier's weight perpendicular to the slope. (See Figure 6.14, which repeats a figure from the chapter on Newton's laws of motion.)

We have

$$
N=w_{y}=w \cos 25^{\circ}=m g \cos 25^{\circ}
$$

Substituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we obtain

$$
f_{\mathrm{k}}=\mu_{\mathrm{k}} m g \cos 25^{\circ}
$$

which can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$.

## Solution

Solving for $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$ gives

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{k}}=\frac{f_{\mathrm{k}}}{N}=\frac{f_{\mathrm{k}}}{w \cos 25^{\circ}}=\frac{f_{\mathrm{k}}}{m g \cos 25^{\circ}}
$$

Substituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation,

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{k}}=\frac{45.0 \mathrm{~N}}{(62 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(0.906)}=0.082
$$

## Significance

This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed in Table 6.1 for waxed wood on snow, but it is still reasonable since values of the coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like this, where an object of mass $m$ slides down a slope that makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, friction is given by $f_{\mathrm{k}}=\mu_{\mathrm{k}} m g \cos \theta$. All objects slide down a slope with constant acceleration under these circumstances.

We have discussed that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, the normal force supporting it is equal in magnitude to its weight. Furthermore, simple friction is always proportional to the normal force. When an object is not on a horizontal surface, as with the inclined plane, we must find the force acting on the object that is directed perpendicular to the surface; it is a component of the weight.

We now derive a useful relationship for calculating coefficient of friction on an inclined plane. Notice that the result applies only for situations in which the object slides at constant speed down the ramp.

An object slides down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object is zero. We can use this fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in Example 6.11, the kinetic friction on a slope is $f_{k}=\mu_{k} m g \cos \theta$. The component of the weight down the slope is equal to $m g \sin \theta$ (see the free-body diagram in Figure 6.14). These forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the acceleration is zero. Writing these out,

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{k}} m g \cos \theta=m g \sin \theta
$$

Solving for $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$, we find that

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{k}}=\frac{m g \sin \theta}{m g \cos \theta}=\tan \theta
$$

Put a coin on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant velocity down the book. You might need to tap the book lightly to get the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal and find $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$. Note that the coin does not start to slide at all until an angle greater than $\theta$ is attained, since the coefficient of static friction is larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Think about how this may affect the value for $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$ and its uncertainty.

## Atomic-Scale Explanations of Friction

The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic (large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have been made in the atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades. Researchers are finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only explain some of the simpler aspects of friction-they also hold the potential for the development of nearly friction-free environments that could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently being converted (unnecessarily) into heat.

Figure 6.15 illustrates one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is explained by microscopic (small-scale) research. We have noted that friction is proportional to the normal force, but not to the amount of area in contact, a somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough surfaces are in contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total area because only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the actual contact area increases, and we find that the friction is proportional to this area.

However, the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler features of friction. The mechanism for how heat is generated is now being determined. In other words, why do surfaces get warmer when rubbed? Essentially, atoms are linked with one another to form lattices. When surfaces rub, the surface atoms adhere and cause atomic lattices to vibrate-essentially creating sound waves that penetrate the material. The sound waves diminish with distance, and their energy is converted into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional wear can also occur between atoms and molecules on the surfaces. Figure 6.16 shows how the tip of a probe drawn across another material is deformed by atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip can be measured and is found to be related to shear stress, which is discussed in $\underline{\text { Static }}$ Equilibrium and Elasticity. The variation in shear stress is remarkable (more than a factor of $10^{12}$ ) and difficult to predict theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a fundamental understanding of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient times-friction.

## Sliding Blocks

The two blocks of Figure 6.17 are attached to each other by a massless string that is wrapped around a frictionless pulley. When the bottom $4.00-\mathrm{kg}$ block is pulled to the left by the constant force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}$, the top $2.00-\mathrm{kg}$ block slides across it to the right. Find the magnitude of the force necessary to move the blocks at constant speed. Assume that the coefficient of kinetic friction between all surfaces is 0.400 .

## Strategy

We analyze the motions of the two blocks separately. The top block is subjected to a contact force exerted by the bottom block. The components of this force are the normal force $N_{1}$ and the frictional force $-0.400 N_{1}$. Other forces on the top block are the tension $T i$ in the string and the weight of the top block itself, $19.6 \mathrm{~N}$. The bottom block is subjected to contact forces due to the top block and due to the floor. The first contact force has components $-N_{1}$ and $0.400 N_{1}$, which are simply reaction forces to the contact forces that the bottom block exerts on the top block. The components of the contact force of the floor are $N_{2}$ and $0.400 N_{2}$. Other forces on this block are $-\boldsymbol{P}$, the tension $\boldsymbol{T i}$, and the weight $-39.2 \mathrm{~N}$.

## Solution

Since the top block is moving horizontally to the right at constant velocity, its acceleration is zero in both the horizontal and the vertical directions. From Newton's second law,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_{x} & =m_{1} a_{x} & \sum F_{y} & =m_{1} a_{y} \\
T-0.400 N_{1} & =0 & N_{1}-19.6 \mathrm{~N} & =0
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving for the two unknowns, we obtain $N_{1}=19.6 \mathrm{~N}$ and $T=0.40 N_{1}=7.84 \mathrm{~N}$. The bottom block is also not accelerating, so the application of Newton's second law to this block gives

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\sum F_{x}=m_{2} a_{x} & \sum F_{y}=m_{2} a_{y} \\
T-P+0.400 N_{1}+0.400 N_{2}=0 & N_{2}-39.2 \mathrm{~N}-N_{1}=0
\end{array}
$$

The values of $N_{1}$ and $T$ were found with the first set of equations. When these values are substituted into the second set of equations, we can determine $N_{2}$ and $P$. They are

$$
N_{2}=58.8 \mathrm{~N} \text { and } P=39.2 \mathrm{~N}
$$

## Significance

Understanding what direction in which to draw the friction force is often troublesome. Notice that each friction force labeled in Figure 6.17 acts in the direction opposite the motion of its corresponding block.

## EXAMPLE 6.13

## A Crate on an Accelerating Truck

A $50.0-\mathrm{kg}$ crate rests on the bed of a truck as shown in Figure 6.18. The coefficients of friction between the surfaces are $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}=0.300$ and $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}=0.400$. Find the frictional force on the crate when the truck is accelerating forward relative to the ground at (a) $2.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, and (b) $5.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

## Strategy

The forces on the crate are its weight and the normal and frictional forces due to contact with the truck bed. We start by assuming that the crate is not slipping. In this case, the static frictional force $f_{\mathrm{s}}$ acts on the crate. Furthermore, the accelerations of the crate and the truck are equal.

## Solution

a. Application of Newton's second law to the crate, using the reference frame attached to the ground, yields

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\sum F_{x} & =m a_{x} & \sum F_{y} & =m a_{y} \\
f_{\mathrm{s}} & =(50.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(2.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right) & N-4.90 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~N} & =(50.0 \mathrm{~kg})(0) \\
& =1.00 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~N} & N & =4.90 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~N}
\end{array}
$$

We can now check the validity of our no-slip assumption. The maximum value of the force of static friction is

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{s}} N=(0.400)\left(4.90 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~N}\right)=196 \mathrm{~N}
$$

whereas the actual force of static friction that acts when the truck accelerates forward at $2.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ is only $1.00 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~N}$. Thus, the assumption of no slipping is valid.

b. If the crate is to move with the truck when it accelerates at $5.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, the force of static friction must be

$$
f_{\mathrm{s}}=m a_{x}=(50.0 \mathrm{~kg})\left(5.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=250 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Since this exceeds the maximum of $196 \mathrm{~N}$, the crate must slip. The frictional force is therefore kinetic and is

$$
f_{k}=\mu_{k} N=(0.300)\left(4.90 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~N}\right)=147 \mathrm{~N} \text {. }
$$

The horizontal acceleration of the crate relative to the ground is now found from

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_{x} & =m a_{x} \\
147 \mathrm{~N} & =(50.0 \mathrm{~kg}) a_{x} \\
\text { so } a_{x} & =2.94 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

Relative to the ground, the truck is accelerating forward at $5.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and the crate is accelerating forward at $2.94 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Hence the crate is sliding backward relative to the bed of the truck with an acceleration $2.94 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}-5.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}=-2.06 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

## EXAMPLE 6.14

## Snowboarding

Earlier, we analyzed the situation of a downhill skier moving at constant velocity to determine the coefficient of kinetic friction. Now let's do a similar analysis to determine acceleration. The snowboarder of Figure 6.19 glides down a slope that is inclined at $\theta=13^{0}$ to the horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the board and the snow is $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}=0.20$. What is the acceleration of the snowboarder?

## Strategy

The forces acting on the snowboarder are her weight and the contact force of the slope, which has a component normal to the incline and a component along the incline (force of kinetic friction). Because she moves along the slope, the most convenient reference frame for analyzing her motion is one with the $x$-axis along and the $y$-axis perpendicular to the incline. In this frame, both the normal and the frictional forces lie along coordinate axes, the components of the weight are $m g \sin \theta$ along the slope and $m g \cos \theta$ at right angles into the slope, and the only acceleration is along the $x$-axis $\left(a_{y}=0\right)$.

## Solution

We can now apply Newton's second law to the snowboarder:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_{x}=m a_{x} \quad \sum F_{y}=m a_{y} \\
& m g \sin \theta-\mu_{k} N=m a_{x} \quad N-m g \cos \theta=m(0)
\end{aligned}
$$

From the second equation, $N=m g \cos \theta$. Upon substituting this into the first equation, we find

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{x} & =g\left(\sin \theta-\mu_{\mathrm{k}} \cos \theta\right) \\
& =g\left(\sin 13^{\circ}-0.20 \cos 13^{\circ}\right)=0.29 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

Notice from this equation that if $\theta$ is small enough or $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$ is large enough, $a_{x}$ is negative, that is, the snowboarder slows down.

### 6.3 Centripetal Force

In Motion in Two and Three Dimensions, we examined the basic concepts of circular motion. An object undergoing circular motion, like one of the race cars shown at the beginning of this chapter, must be accelerating because it is changing the direction of its velocity. We proved that this centrally directed acceleration, called centripetal acceleration, is given by the formula

$$
a_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the object, directed along a tangent line to the curve at any instant. If we know the angular velocity $\omega$, then we can use

$$
a_{\mathrm{c}}=r \omega^{2}
$$

Angular velocity gives the rate at which the object is turning through the curve, in units of rad/s. This acceleration acts along the radius of the curved path and is thus also referred to as a radial acceleration.

An acceleration must be produced by a force. Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth's gravity on the Moon, friction between roller skates and a rink floor, a banked roadway's force on a car, and forces on the tube of a spinning centrifuge. Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force. The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature, the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration. According to Newton's second law of motion, net force is mass times acceleration: $F_{\text {net }}=m a$. For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is the centripetal acceleration: $a=a_{\mathrm{c}}$. Thus, the magnitude of centripetal force $F_{\mathrm{c}}$ is

$$
F_{\mathrm{c}}=m a_{\mathrm{c}}
$$

By substituting the expressions for centripetal acceleration $a_{\mathrm{c}}\left(a_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{v^{2}}{r} ; a_{\mathrm{c}}=r \omega^{2}\right)$, we get two expressions for the centripetal force $F_{\mathrm{c}}$ in terms of mass, velocity, angular velocity, and radius of curvature:

$$
F_{\mathrm{c}}=m \frac{v^{2}}{r} ; \quad F_{\mathrm{c}}=m r \omega^{2}
$$

You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Centripetal force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is always perpendicular to the path and points to the center of curvature, because $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is perpendicular to the velocity and points to the center of curvature. Note that if you solve the first expression for $r$, you get

$$
r=\frac{m v^{2}}{F_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$

This implies that for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small radius of curvature-that is, a tight curve, as in Figure 6.20.

$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{c}} \text { is parallel to } \overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}_{c} \text { since } \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{\mathrm{c}}=m \overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}_{c}
$$

## What Coefficient of Friction Do Cars Need on a Flat Curve?

(a) Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a $900.0-\mathrm{kg}$ car that negotiates a $500.0-\mathrm{m}$ radius curve at $25.00 \mathrm{~m} /$ s. (b) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the minimum static coefficient of friction between the tires and the road, static friction being the reason that keeps the car from slipping (Figure 6.21).

## Strategy

a. We know that $F_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}$. Thus,

$$
F_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}=\frac{(900.0 \mathrm{~kg})(25.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{(500.0 \mathrm{~m})}=1125 \mathrm{~N}
$$

b. Figure 6.21 shows the forces acting on the car on an unbanked (level ground) curve. Friction is to the left, keeping the car from slipping, and because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the friction is the centripetal force in this case. We know that the maximum static friction (at which the tires roll but do not slip) is $\mu_{\mathrm{s}} N$, where $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the static coefficient of friction and $N$ is the normal force. The normal force equals the car's weight on level ground, so $N=m g$. Thus the centripetal force in this situation is

$$
F_{\mathrm{c}} \equiv f=\mu_{\mathrm{s}} N=\mu_{\mathrm{s}} m g
$$

Now we have a relationship between centripetal force and the coefficient of friction. Using the equation

$$
F_{\mathrm{c}}=m \frac{v^{2}}{r}
$$

we obtain

$$
m \frac{v^{2}}{r}=\mu_{\mathrm{s}} m g
$$

We solve this for $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$, noting that mass cancels, and obtain

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{v^{2}}{r g}
$$

Substituting the knowns,

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{(25.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{(500.0 \mathrm{~m})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}=0.13
$$

(Because coefficients of friction are approximate, the answer is given to only two digits.)

## Significance

The coefficient of friction found in Figure 6.21(b) is much smaller than is typically found between tires and roads. The car still negotiates the curve if the coefficient is greater than 0.13 , because static friction is a responsive force, able to assume a value less than but no more than $\mu_{\mathrm{s}} N$. A higher coefficient would also allow the car to negotiate the curve at a higher speed, but if the coefficient of friction is less, the safe speed would be less than $25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Note that mass cancels, implying that, in this example, it does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the turn. Mass cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which in turn is proportional to mass. If the surface of the road were banked, the normal force would be greater, as discussed next.

## Banked Curves

Let us now consider banked curves, where the slope of the road helps you negotiate the curve (Figure 6.22). The greater the angle $\theta$, the faster you can take the curve. Race tracks for bikes as well as cars, for example, often have steeply banked curves. In an "ideally banked curve," the angle $\theta$ is such that you can negotiate the curve at a certain speed without the aid of friction between the tires and the road. We will derive an expression for $\theta$ for an ideally banked curve and consider an example related to it.

For ideal banking, the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of friction. The components of the normal force $N$ in the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal force and the weight of the car, respectively. In cases in which forces are not parallel, it is most convenient to consider components along perpendicular axes-in this case, the vertical and horizontal directions.

Figure 6.22 shows a free-body diagram for a car on a frictionless banked curve. If the angle $\theta$ is ideal for the speed and radius, then the net external force equals the necessary centripetal force. The only two external forces acting on the car are its weight $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{w}}$ and the normal force of the road $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{N}}$. (A frictionless surface can only exert a force perpendicular to the surface-that is, a normal force.) These two forces must add to give a net
external force that is horizontal toward the center of curvature and has magnitude $m v^{2} / r$. Because this is the crucial force and it is horizontal, we use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes. Only the normal force has a horizontal component, so this must equal the centripetal force, that is,

$$
N \sin \theta=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
$$

Because the car does not leave the surface of the road, the net vertical force must be zero, meaning that the vertical components of the two external forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. From Figure 6.22, we see that the vertical component of the normal force is $N \cos \theta$, and the only other vertical force is the car's weight. These must be equal in magnitude; thus,

$$
N \cos \theta=m g
$$

Now we can combine these two equations to eliminate $N$ and get an expression for $\theta$, as desired. Solving the second equation for $N=m g /(\cos \theta)$ and substituting this into the first yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
m g \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} & =\frac{m v^{2}}{r} \\
m g \tan \theta & =\frac{m v^{2}}{r} \\
\tan \theta & =\frac{v^{2}}{r g}
\end{aligned}
$$

Taking the inverse tangent gives

$$
\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{r g}\right)
$$

This expression can be understood by considering how $\theta$ depends on $v$ and $r$. A large $\theta$ is obtained for a large $v$ and a small $r$. That is, roads must be steeply banked for high speeds and sharp curves. Friction helps, because it allows you to take the curve at greater or lower speed than if the curve were frictionless. Note that $\theta$ does not depend on the mass of the vehicle.

## EXAMPLE 6.16

## What Is the Ideal Speed to Take a Steeply Banked Tight Curve?

Curves on some test tracks and race courses, such as Daytona International Speedway in Florida, are very steeply banked. This banking, with the aid of tire friction and very stable car configurations, allows the curves to be taken at very high speed. To illustrate, calculate the speed at which a $100.0-\mathrm{m}$ radius curve banked at $31.0^{\circ}$ should be driven if the road were frictionless.

## Strategy

We first note that all terms in the expression for the ideal angle of a banked curve except for speed are known; thus, we need only rearrange it so that speed appears on the left-hand side and then substitute known quantities.

## Solution

Starting with

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{v^{2}}{r g}
$$

we get

$$
v=\sqrt{r g \tan \theta}
$$

Noting that $\tan 31.0^{\circ}=0.609$, we obtain

$$
v=\sqrt{(100.0 \mathrm{~m})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(0.609)}=24.4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

This is just about $165 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$, consistent with a very steeply banked and rather sharp curve. Tire friction enables a vehicle to take the curve at significantly higher speeds.

Airplanes also make turns by banking. The lift force, due to the force of the air on the wing, acts at right angles to the wing. When the airplane banks, the pilot is obtaining greater lift than necessary for level flight. The vertical component of lift balances the airplane's weight, and the horizontal component accelerates the plane. The banking angle shown in Figure 6.23 is given by $\theta$. We analyze the forces in the same way we treat the case of the car rounding a banked curve.

## Inertial Forces and Noninertial (Accelerated) Frames: The Coriolis Force

What do taking off in a jet airplane, turning a corner in a car, riding a merry-go-round, and the circular motion of a tropical cyclone have in common? Each exhibits inertial forces-forces that merely seem to arise from motion, because the observer's frame of reference is accelerating or rotating. When taking off in a jet, most people would agree it feels as if you are being pushed back into the seat as the airplane accelerates down the runway. Yet a physicist would say that you tend to remain stationary while the seat pushes forward on you. An even more common experience occurs when you make a tight curve in your car-say, to the right (Figure 6.24). You feel as if you are thrown (that is, forced) toward the left relative to the car. Again, a physicist would say that you are going in a straight line (recall Newton's first law) but the car moves to the right, not that you are
experiencing a force from the left.

We can reconcile these points of view by examining the frames of reference used. Let us concentrate on people in a car. Passengers instinctively use the car as a frame of reference, whereas a physicist might use Earth. The physicist might make this choice because Earth is nearly an inertial frame of reference, in which all forces have an identifiable physical origin. In such a frame of reference, Newton's laws of motion take the form given in Newton's Laws of Motion. The car is a noninertial frame of reference because it is accelerated to the side. The force to the left sensed by car passengers is an inertial force having no physical origin (it is due purely to the inertia of the passenger, not to some physical cause such as tension, friction, or gravitation). The car, as well as the driver, is actually accelerating to the right. This inertial force is said to be an inertial force because it does not have a physical origin, such as gravity.

A physicist will choose whatever reference frame is most convenient for the situation being analyzed. There is no problem to a physicist in including inertial forces and Newton's second law, as usual, if that is more convenient, for example, on a merry-go-round or on a rotating planet. Noninertial (accelerated) frames of reference are used when it is useful to do so. Different frames of reference must be considered in discussing the motion of an astronaut in a spacecraft traveling at speeds near the speed of light, as you will appreciate in the study of the special theory of relativity.

Let us now take a mental ride on a merry-go-round-specifically, a rapidly rotating playground merry-goround (Figure 6.25). You take the merry-go-round to be your frame of reference because you rotate together. When rotating in that noninertial frame of reference, you feel an inertial force that tends to throw you off; this is often referred to as a centrifugal force (not to be confused with centripetal force). Centrifugal force is a commonly used term, but it does not actually exist. You must hang on tightly to counteract your inertia (which people often refer to as centrifugal force). In Earth's frame of reference, there is no force trying to throw you off; we emphasize that centrifugal force is a fiction. You must hang on to make yourself go in a circle because otherwise you would go in a straight line, right off the merry-go-round, in keeping with Newton's first law. But the force you exert acts toward the center of the circle.

This inertial effect, carrying you away from the center of rotation if there is no centripetal force to cause circular motion, is put to good use in centrifuges (Figure 6.26). A centrifuge spins a sample very rapidly, as mentioned earlier in this chapter. Viewed from the rotating frame of reference, the inertial force throws particles outward, hastening their sedimentation. The greater the angular velocity, the greater the centrifugal force. But what really happens is that the inertia of the particles carries them along a line tangent to the circle while the test tube is forced in a circular path by a centripetal force.

Let us now consider what happens if something moves in a rotating frame of reference. For example, what if you slide a ball directly away from the center of the merry-go-round, as shown in Figure 6.27? The ball follows a straight path relative to Earth (assuming negligible friction) and a path curved to the right on the merry-goround's surface. A person standing next to the merry-go-round sees the ball moving straight and the merry-goround rotating underneath it. In the merry-go-round's frame of reference, we explain the apparent curve to the
right by using an inertial force, called the Coriolis force, which causes the ball to curve to the right. The Coriolis force can be used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and allows us to apply Newton's laws in noninertial frames of reference.

Up until now, we have considered Earth to be an inertial frame of reference with little or no worry about effects due to its rotation. Yet such effects do exist-in the rotation of weather systems, for example. Most consequences of Earth's rotation can be qualitatively understood by analogy with the merry-go-round. Viewed from above the North Pole, Earth rotates counterclockwise, as does the merry-go-round in Figure 6.27. As on the merry-go-round, any motion in Earth's Northern Hemisphere experiences a Coriolis force to the right. Just the opposite occurs in the Southern Hemisphere; there, the force is to the left. Because Earth's angular velocity is small, the Coriolis force is usually negligible, but for large-scale motions, such as wind patterns, it has substantial effects.

The Coriolis force causes hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate in the counterclockwise direction, whereas tropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere rotate in the clockwise direction. (The terms hurricane, typhoon, and tropical storm are regionally specific names for cyclones, which are storm systems characterized by low pressure centers, strong winds, and heavy rains.) Figure 6.28 helps show how these rotations take place. Air flows toward any region of low pressure, and tropical cyclones contain particularly low pressures. Thus winds flow toward the center of a tropical cyclone or a low-pressure weather system at the surface. In the Northern Hemisphere, these inward winds are deflected to the right, as shown in the figure, producing a counterclockwise circulation at the surface for low-pressure zones of any type. Low pressure at the surface is associated with rising air, which also produces cooling and cloud formation, making low-pressure patterns quite visible from space. Conversely, wind circulation around high-pressure zones is clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere but is less visible because high pressure is associated with sinking air, producing clear skies.

The rotation of tropical cyclones and the path of a ball on a merry-go-round can just as well be explained by inertia and the rotation of the system underneath. When noninertial frames are used, inertial forces, such as the Coriolis force, must be invented to explain the curved path. There is no identifiable physical source for these inertial forces. In an inertial frame, inertia explains the path, and no force is found to be without an identifiable source. Either view allows us to describe nature, but a view in an inertial frame is the simplest in the sense that all forces have origins and explanations.

### 6.4 Drag Force and Terminal Speed

Another interesting force in everyday life is the force of drag on an object when it is moving in a fluid (either a gas or a liquid). You feel the drag force when you move your hand through water. You might also feel it if you move your hand during a strong wind. The faster you move your hand, the harder it is to move. You feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the air-you have decreased the area of your hand that faces the direction of motion.

## Drag Forces

Like friction, the drag force always opposes the motion of an object. Unlike simple friction, the drag force is proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid. This functionality is complicated and depends upon the shape of the object, its size, its velocity, and the fluid it is in. For most large objects such as cyclists, cars, and baseballs not moving too slowly, the magnitude of the drag force $F_{\mathrm{D}}$ is proportional to the square of the speed of the object. We can write this relationship mathematically as $F_{\mathrm{D}} \propto v^{2}$. When taking into
account other factors, this relationship becomes

$$
F_{\mathrm{D}}=\frac{1}{2} C \rho A v^{2}
$$

where $C$ is the drag coefficient, $A$ is the area of the object facing the fluid, and $\rho$ is the density of the fluid. (Recall that density is mass per unit volume.) This equation can also be written in a more generalized fashion as $F_{\mathrm{D}}=b v^{n}$, where $b$ is a constant equivalent to $0.5 C \rho A$. We have set the exponent $n$ for these equations as 2 because when an object is moving at high velocity through air, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the speed. As we shall see in Fluid Mechanics, for small particles moving at low speeds in a fluid, the exponent $n$ is equal to 1 .

## Drag Force

Drag force $F_{\mathrm{D}}$ is proportional to the square of the speed of the object. Mathematically,

$$
F_{\mathrm{D}}=\frac{1}{2} C \rho A v^{2}
$$

where $C$ is the drag coefficient, $A$ is the area of the object facing the fluid, and $\rho$ is the density of the fluid.

Athletes as well as car designers seek to reduce the drag force to lower their race times (Figure 6.29). Aerodynamic shaping of an automobile can reduce the drag force and thus increase a car's gas mileage.

The value of the drag coefficient $C$ is determined empirically, usually with the use of a wind tunnel (Figure 6.30).

The drag coefficient can depend upon velocity, but we assume that it is a constant here. Table 6.2 lists some typical drag coefficients for a variety of objects. Notice that the drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity. At highway speeds, over $50 \%$ of the power of a car is used to overcome air drag. The most fuel-efficient cruising speed is about 70-80 km/h (about 45-50 mi/h). For this reason, during the 1970s oil crisis in the United States, maximum speeds on highways were set at about $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}(55 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h})$.

Table 6.2 Typical Values of Drag Coefficient $C$

Substantial research is under way in the sporting world to minimize drag. The dimples on golf balls are being redesigned, as are the clothes that athletes wear. Bicycle racers and some swimmers and runners wear full bodysuits. Australian Cathy Freeman wore a full body suit in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and won a gold medal in the $400-\mathrm{m}$ race. Many swimmers in the 2008 Beijing Olympics wore (Speedo) body suits; it might have made a difference in breaking many world records (Figure 6.31). Most elite swimmers (and cyclists) shave their body hair. Such innovations can have the effect of slicing away milliseconds in a race, sometimes making the difference between a gold and a silver medal. One consequence is that careful and precise guidelines must be continuously developed to maintain the integrity of the sport.

Smoother "skin" and more compression forces on a swimmer's body provide at least $10 \%$ less drag. (credit: NASA/Kathy Barnstorff)

## Terminal Velocity

Some interesting situations connected to Newton's second law occur when considering the effects of drag forces upon a moving object. For instance, consider a skydiver falling through air under the influence of gravity. The two forces acting on him are the force of gravity and the drag force (ignoring the small buoyant force). The downward force of gravity remains constant regardless of the velocity at which the person is moving. However, as the person's velocity increases, the magnitude of the drag force increases until the magnitude of the drag force is equal to the gravitational force, thus producing a net force of zero. A zero net force means that there is no acceleration, as shown by Newton's second law. At this point, the person's velocity remains constant and we say that the person has reached his terminal velocity $\left(v_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$. Since $F_{\mathrm{D}}$ is proportional to the speed squared, a heavier skydiver must go faster for $F_{\mathrm{D}}$ to equal his weight. Let's see how this works out more quantitatively.

At the terminal velocity,

$$
F_{\text {net }}=m g-F_{\mathrm{D}}=m a=0
$$

Thus,

$$
m g=F_{\mathrm{D}}
$$

Using the equation for drag force, we have

$$
m g=\frac{1}{2} C \rho A v_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}
$$

Solving for the velocity, we obtain

$$
v_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{\frac{2 m g}{\rho C A}}
$$

Assume the density of air is $\rho=1.21 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. A $75-\mathrm{kg}$ skydiver descending head first has a cross-sectional area of approximately $A=0.18 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and a drag coefficient of approximately $C=0.70$. We find that

$$
v_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{\frac{2(75 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}{\left(1.21 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)(0.70)\left(0.18 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}}=98 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=350 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}
$$

This means a skydiver with a mass of $75 \mathrm{~kg}$ achieves a terminal velocity of about $350 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ while traveling in a headfirst position, minimizing the area and his drag. In a spread-eagle position, that terminal velocity may decrease to about $200 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ as the area increases. This terminal velocity becomes much smaller after the parachute opens.

## EXAMPLE 6.17

## Terminal Velocity of a Skydiver

Find the terminal velocity of an $85-\mathrm{kg}$ skydiver falling in a spread-eagle position.

## Strategy

At terminal velocity, $F_{\text {net }}=0$. Thus, the drag force on the skydiver must equal the force of gravity (the person's weight). Using the equation of drag force, we find $m g=\frac{1}{2} \rho C A v^{2}$.

## Solution

The terminal velocity $v_{\mathrm{T}}$ can be written as

$$
v_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{\frac{2 m g}{\rho C A}}=\sqrt{\frac{2(85 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.80 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}{\left(1.21 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)(1.0)\left(0.70 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}}=44 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

This result is consistent with the value for $v_{\mathrm{T}}$ mentioned earlier. The $75-\mathrm{kg}$ skydiver going feet first had a terminal velocity of $v_{\mathrm{T}}=98 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. He weighed less but had a smaller frontal area and so a smaller drag due to the air.

The size of the object that is falling through air presents another interesting application of air drag. If you fall from a $5-\mathrm{m}$-high branch of a tree, you will likely get hurt-possibly fracturing a bone. However, a small squirrel does this all the time, without getting hurt. You do not reach a terminal velocity in such a short distance, but the squirrel does.

The following interesting quote on animal size and terminal velocity is from a 1928 essay by a British biologist, J. B. S. Haldane, titled "On Being the Right Size."

"To the mouse and any smaller animal, [gravity] presents practically no dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, and a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to
movement by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal's length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force."

The above quadratic dependence of air drag upon velocity does not hold if the object is very small, is going very slow, or is in a denser medium than air. Then we find that the drag force is proportional just to the velocity. This relationship is given by Stokes' law.

## Stokes' Law

For a spherical object falling in a medium, the drag force is

$$
F_{\mathrm{s}}=6 \pi r \eta v
$$

where $r$ is the radius of the object, $\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid, and $v$ is the object's velocity.

Good examples of Stokes' law are provided by microorganisms, pollen, and dust particles. Because each of these objects is so small, we find that many of these objects travel unaided only at a constant (terminal) velocity. Terminal velocities for bacteria (size about $1 \mu \mathrm{m}$ ) can be about $2 \mu \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$. To move at a greater speed, many bacteria swim using flagella (organelles shaped like little tails) that are powered by little motors embedded in the cell.

Sediment in a lake can move at a greater terminal velocity (about $5 \mu \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ ), so it can take days for it to reach the bottom of the lake after being deposited on the surface.

If we compare animals living on land with those in water, you can see how drag has influenced evolution. Fish, dolphins, and even massive whales are streamlined in shape to reduce drag forces. Birds are streamlined and migratory species that fly large distances often have particular features such as long necks. Flocks of birds fly in the shape of a spearhead as the flock forms a streamlined pattern (Figure 6.32). In humans, one important example of streamlining is the shape of sperm, which need to be efficient in their use of energy.

## The Calculus of Velocity-Dependent Frictional Forces

When a body slides across a surface, the frictional force on it is approximately constant and given by $\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N$. Unfortunately, the frictional force on a body moving through a liquid or a gas does not behave so simply. This drag force is generally a complicated function of the body's velocity. However, for a body moving in a straight line at moderate speeds through a liquid such as water, the frictional force can often be approximated by

$$
f_{R}=-b v
$$

where $b$ is a constant whose value depends on the dimensions and shape of the body and the properties of the liquid, and $v$ is the velocity of the body. Two situations for which the frictional force can be represented by this equation are a motorboat moving through water and a small object falling slowly through a liquid.

Let's consider the object falling through a liquid. The free-body diagram of this object with the positive direction downward is shown in Figure 6.33. Newton's second law in the vertical direction gives the differential equation

$$
m g-b v=m \frac{d v}{d t}
$$

where we have written the acceleration as $d v / d t$. As $v$ increases, the frictional force $-b v$ increases until it matches $\mathrm{mg}$. At this point, there is no acceleration and the velocity remains constant at the terminal velocity $v_{\mathrm{T}}$. From the previous equation,

$$
m g-b v_{\mathrm{T}}=0
$$

so

$$
v_{\mathrm{T}}=\frac{m g}{b}
$$

We can find the object's velocity by integrating the differential equation for v. First, we rearrange terms in this equation to obtain

$$
\frac{d v}{g-(b / m) v}=d t
$$

Assuming that $v=0$ at $t=0$, integration of this equation yields

$$
\int_{0}^{v} \frac{d v^{\prime}}{g-(b / m) v^{\prime}}=\int_{0}^{t} d t^{\prime}
$$

or

$$
-\left.\frac{m}{b} \ln \left(g-\frac{b}{m} v^{\prime}\right)\right|_{0} ^{v}=\left.t^{\prime}\right|_{0} ^{t}
$$

where $v^{\prime}$ and $t^{\prime}$ are dummy variables of integration. With the limits given, we find

$$
-\frac{m}{b}\left[\ln \left(g-\frac{b}{m} v\right)-\ln g\right]=t
$$

Since $\ln A-\ln B=\ln (A / B)$, and $\ln (A / B)=x$ implies $e^{x}=A / B$, we obtain

$$
\frac{g-(b v / m)}{g}=e^{-b t / m}
$$

and

$$
v=\frac{m g}{b}\left(1-e^{-b t / m}\right)
$$

Notice that as $t \rightarrow \infty, v \rightarrow m g / b=v_{\mathrm{T}}$, which is the terminal velocity.

The position at any time may be found by integrating the equation for $v$. With $v=d y / d t$,

$$
d y=\frac{m g}{b}\left(1-e^{-b t / m}\right) d t
$$

Assuming $y=0$ when $t=0$,

$$
\int_{0}^{y} d y^{\prime}=\frac{m g}{b} \int_{0}^{t}\left(1-e^{-b t^{\prime} / m}\right) d t^{\prime}
$$

which integrates to

$$
y=\frac{m g}{b} t+\frac{m^{2} g}{b^{2}}\left(e^{-b t / m}-1\right)
$$

## EXAMPLE 6.18

## Effect of the Resistive Force on a Motorboat

A motorboat is moving across a lake at a speed $v_{0}$ when its motor suddenly freezes up and stops. The boat then slows down under the frictional force $f_{R}=-b v$. (a) What are the velocity and position of the boat as functions of time? (b) If the boat slows down from 4.0 to $1.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in $10 \mathrm{~s}$, how far does it travel before stopping?

## Solution

a. With the motor stopped, the only horizontal force on the boat is $f_{R}=-b v$, so from Newton's second law,

$$
m \frac{d v}{d t}=-b v
$$

which we can write as

$$
\frac{d v}{v}=-\frac{b}{m} d t
$$

Integrating this equation between the time zero when the velocity is $v_{0}$ and the time $t$ when the velocity is $v$, we have

$$
\int_{0}^{v} \frac{d v^{\prime}}{v^{\prime}}=-\frac{b}{m} \int_{0}^{t} d t^{\prime}
$$

Thus,

$$
\ln \frac{v}{v_{0}}=-\frac{b}{m} t
$$

which, since $\ln A=x$ implies $e^{x}=A$, we can write this as

$$
v=v_{0} e^{-b t / m}
$$

Now from the definition of velocity,

$$
\frac{d x}{d t}=v_{0} e^{-b t / m}
$$

so we have

$$
d x=v_{0} e^{-b t / m} d t
$$

With the initial position zero, we have

$$
\int_{0}^{x} d x^{\prime}=v_{0} \int_{0}^{t} e^{-b t^{\prime} / m} d t^{\prime}
$$

and

$$
x=-\left.\frac{m v_{0}}{b} e^{-b t^{\prime} / m}\right|_{0} ^{t}=\frac{m v_{0}}{b}\left(1-e^{-b t / m}\right)
$$

As time increases, $e^{-b t / m} \rightarrow 0$, and the position of the boat approaches a limiting value

$$
x_{\max }=\frac{m v_{0}}{b}
$$

Although this tells us that the boat takes an infinite amount of time to reach $x_{\max }$, the boat effectively stops after a reasonable time. For example, at $t=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{b}$, we have

$$
v=v_{0} e^{-10} \simeq 4.5 \times 10^{-5} v_{0}
$$

whereas we also have

$$
x=x_{\max }\left(1-e^{-10}\right) \simeq 0.99995 x_{\max }
$$

Therefore, the boat's velocity and position have essentially reached their final values.

b. With $v_{0}=4.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $v=1.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, we have $1.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=(4.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}) e^{-(b / m)(10 \mathrm{~s})}$, so

$$
\ln 0.25=-\ln 4.0=-\frac{b}{m}(10 \mathrm{~s})
$$

and

$$
\frac{b}{m}=\frac{1}{10} \ln 4.0 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=0.14 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

Now the boat's limiting position is

$$
x_{\max }=\frac{m v_{0}}{b}=\frac{4.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{0.14 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}=29 \mathrm{~m}
$$

## Significance

In the both of the previous examples, we found "limiting" values. The terminal velocity is the same as the limiting velocity, which is the velocity of the falling object after a (relatively) long time has passed. Similarly, the limiting distance of the boat is the distance the boat will travel after a long amount of time has passed. Due to the properties of exponential decay, the time involved to reach either of these values is actually not too long (certainly not an infinite amount of time!) but they are quickly found by taking the limit to infinity.
