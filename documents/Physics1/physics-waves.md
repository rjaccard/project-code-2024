# CHAPTER 16 Waves 

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we study the physics of wave motion. We concentrate on mechanical waves, which are disturbances that move through a medium such as air or water. Like simple harmonic motion studied in the preceding chapter, the energy transferred through the medium is proportional to the amplitude squared. Surface water waves in the ocean are transverse waves in which the energy of the wave travels horizontally while the water oscillates up and down due to some restoring force. In the picture above, a buoy is used to convert the awesome power of ocean waves into electricity. The up-and-down motion of the buoy generated as the waves pass is converted into rotational motion that turns a rotor in an electric generator. The generator charges batteries, which are in turn used to provide a consistent energy source for the end user. This model was successfully tested by the US Navy in a project to provide power to coastal security networks and
was able to provide an average power of $350 \mathrm{~W}$. The buoy survived the difficult ocean environment, including operation off the New Jersey coast through Hurricane Irene in 2011.

The concepts presented in this chapter will be the foundation for many interesting topics, from the transmission of information to the concepts of quantum mechanics.

### 16.1 Traveling Waves

We saw in Oscillations that oscillatory motion is an important type of behavior that can be used to model a wide range of physical phenomena. Oscillatory motion is also important because oscillations can generate waves, which are of fundamental importance in physics. Many of the terms and equations we studied in the chapter on oscillations apply equally well to wave motion (Figure 16.2).

## Types of Waves

A wave is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. There are three basic types of waves: mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves, and matter waves.

Basic mechanical waves are governed by Newton's laws and require a medium. A medium is the substance a mechanical waves propagates through, and the medium produces an elastic restoring force when it is deformed. Mechanical waves transfer energy and momentum, without transferring mass. Some examples of mechanical waves are water waves, sound waves, and seismic waves. The medium for water waves is water; for sound waves, the medium is usually air. (Sound waves can travel in other media as well; we will look at that in more detail in Sound.) For surface water waves, the disturbance occurs on the surface of the water, perhaps
created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is a change in air pressure, perhaps created by the oscillating cone inside a speaker or a vibrating tuning fork. In both cases, the disturbance is the oscillation of the molecules of the fluid. In mechanical waves, energy and momentum transfer with the motion of the wave, whereas the mass oscillates around an equilibrium point. (We discuss this in Energy and Power of a Wave.) Earthquakes generate seismic waves from several types of disturbances, including the disturbance of Earth's surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Seismic waves travel through the solids and liquids that form Earth. In this chapter, we focus on mechanical waves.

Electromagnetic waves are associated with oscillations in electric and magnetic fields and do not require a medium. Examples include gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet waves, visible light, infrared waves, microwaves, and radio waves. Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum at the speed of light,

$v=c=2.99792458 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. For example, light from distant stars travels through the vacuum of space and reaches Earth. Electromagnetic waves have some characteristics that are similar to mechanical waves; they are covered in more detail in Electromagnetic Waves.

Matter waves are a central part of the branch of physics known as quantum mechanics. These waves are associated with protons, electrons, neutrons, and other fundamental particles found in nature. The theory that all types of matter have wave-like properties was first proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1924. Matter waves are discussed in Photons and Matter Waves.

## Mechanical Waves

Mechanical waves exhibit characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, wavelength, period, frequency, and energy. All wave characteristics can be described by a small set of underlying principles.

The simplest mechanical waves repeat themselves for several cycles and are associated with simple harmonic motion. These simple harmonic waves can be modeled using some combination of sine and cosine functions. For example, consider the simplified surface water wave that moves across the surface of water as illustrated in Figure 16.3. Unlike complex ocean waves, in surface water waves, the medium, in this case water, moves vertically, oscillating up and down, whereas the disturbance of the wave moves horizontally through the medium. In Figure 16.3, the waves causes a seagull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs (peaks and valleys) pass under the bird. The crest is the highest point of the wave, and the trough is the lowest part of the wave. The time for one complete oscillation of the up-and-down motion is the wave's period $T$. The wave's frequency is the number of waves that pass through a point per unit time and is equal to $f=1 / T$. The period can be expressed using any convenient unit of time but is usually measured in seconds; frequency is usually measured in hertz $(\mathrm{Hz})$, where $1 \mathrm{~Hz}=1 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

The length of the wave is called the wavelength and is represented by the Greek letter lambda $(\lambda)$, which is measured in any convenient unit of length, such as a centimeter or meter. The wavelength can be measured between any two similar points along the medium that have the same height and the same slope. In Figure 16.3, the wavelength is shown measured between two crests. As stated above, the period of the wave is equal to the time for one oscillation, but it is also equal to the time for one wavelength to pass through a point along the wave's path.

The amplitude of the wave $(A)$ is a measure of the maximum displacement of the medium from its equilibrium position. In the figure, the equilibrium position is indicated by the dotted line, which is the height of the water if there were no waves moving through it. In this case, the wave is symmetrical, the crest of the wave is a distance $+A$ above the equilibrium position, and the trough is a distance $-A$ below the equilibrium position. The units for the amplitude can be centimeters or meters, or any convenient unit of distance.

The water wave in the figure moves through the medium with a propagation velocity $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}$. The magnitude of the wave velocity is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in the time of one period, and the wave speed is the magnitude of wave velocity. In equation form, this is

$$
v=\frac{\lambda}{T}=\lambda f
$$

This fundamental relationship holds for all types of waves. For water waves, $v$ is the speed of a surface wave; for sound, $v$ is the speed of sound; and for visible light, $v$ is the speed of light.

## Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

We have seen that a simple mechanical wave consists of a periodic disturbance that propagates from one place to another through a medium. In Figure 16.4(a), the wave propagates in the horizontal direction, whereas the medium is disturbed in the vertical direction. Such a wave is called a transverse wave. In a transverse wave, the wave may propagate in any direction, but the disturbance of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation. Figure 16.4(b) shows an example of a longitudinal wave. The size of the disturbance is its amplitude $A$ and is completely independent of the speed of propagation $v$.

A simple graphical representation of a section of the spring shown in Figure 16.4(b) is shown in Figure 16.5. Figure 16.5(a) shows the equilibrium position of the spring before any waves move down it. A point on the spring is marked with a blue dot. Figure 16.5(b) through (g) show snapshots of the spring taken one-quarter of a period apart, sometime after the end of 'the spring is oscillated back and forth in the $x$-direction at a
constant frequency. The disturbance of the wave is seen as the compressions and the expansions of the spring. Note that the blue dot oscillates around its equilibrium position a distance $A$, as the longitudinal wave moves in the positive $x$-direction with a constant speed. The distance $A$ is the amplitude of the wave. The $y$-position of the dot does not change as the wave moves through the spring. The wavelength of the wave is measured in part (d). The wavelength depends on the speed of the wave and the frequency of the driving force.

Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. Examples of transverse waves are the waves on stringed instruments or surface waves on water, such as ripples moving on a pond. Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. With sound waves, the disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids. Fluids do not have appreciable shear strength, and for this reason, the sound waves in them are longitudinal waves. Sound in solids can have both longitudinal and transverse components, such as those in a seismic wave. Earthquakes generate seismic waves under Earth's surface with both longitudinal and transverse components (called compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves, respectively). The components of seismic waves have important individual characteristics-they propagate at different speeds, for example. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water. Ocean waves also have both transverse and longitudinal components.

## EXAMPLE 16.1

## Wave on a String

A student takes a $30.00-\mathrm{m}-\mathrm{long}$ string and attaches one end to the wall in the physics lab. The student then holds the free end of the rope, keeping the tension constant in the rope. The student then begins to send waves
down the string by moving the end of the string up and down with a frequency of $2.00 \mathrm{~Hz}$. The maximum displacement of the end of the string is $20.00 \mathrm{~cm}$. The first wave hits the lab wall $6.00 \mathrm{~s}$ after it was created. (a) What is the speed of the wave? (b) What is the period of the wave? (c) What is the wavelength of the wave?

## Strategy

a. The speed of the wave can be derived by dividing the distance traveled by the time.

b. The period of the wave is the inverse of the frequency of the driving force.

c. The wavelength can be found from the speed and the period $v=\lambda / T$.

## Solution

a. The first wave traveled $30.00 \mathrm{~m}$ in $6.00 \mathrm{~s}$ :

$$
v=\frac{30.00 \mathrm{~m}}{6.00 \mathrm{~s}}=5.00 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}
$$

b. The period is equal to the inverse of the frequency:

$$
T=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{2.00 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}=0.50 \mathrm{~s}
$$

c. The wavelength is equal to the velocity times the period:

$$
\lambda=v T=5.00 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}(0.50 \mathrm{~s})=2.50 \mathrm{~m}
$$

## Significance

The frequency of the wave produced by an oscillating driving force is equal to the frequency of the driving force.

## EXAMPLE 16.2

## Characteristics of a Wave

A transverse mechanical wave propagates in the positive $x$-direction through a spring (as shown in Figure 16.4(a)) with a constant wave speed, and the medium oscillates between $+A$ and $-A$ around an equilibrium position. The graph in Figure 16.6 shows the height of the spring $(y)$ versus the position $(x)$, where the $x$-axis points in the direction of propagation. The figure shows the height of the spring versus the $x$-position at $t=0.00 \mathrm{~s}$ as a dotted line and the wave at $t=3.00 \mathrm{~s}$ as a solid line. Assume the wave has not traveled more than 1 wavelength in this time. (a) Determine the wavelength and amplitude of the wave. (b) Find the propagation velocity of the wave. (c) Calculate the period and frequency of the wave.

## Strategy

a. The amplitude and wavelength can be determined from the graph.

b. Since the velocity is constant, the velocity of the wave can be found by dividing the distance traveled by the wave by the time it took the wave to travel the distance.

c. The period can be found from $v=\frac{\lambda}{T}$ and the frequency from $f=\frac{1}{T}$.

## Solution

a. Read the wavelength from the graph, looking at the purple arrow in Figure 16.7. Read the amplitude by looking at the green arrow. The wavelength is $\lambda=8.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ and the amplitude is $A=6.00 \mathrm{~cm}$.

b. The distance the wave traveled from time $t=0.00 \mathrm{~s}$ to time $t=3.00 \mathrm{~s}$ can be seen in the graph. Consider the red arrow, which shows the distance the crest has moved in $3 \mathrm{~s}$. The distance is

$8.00 \mathrm{~cm}-2.00 \mathrm{~cm}=6.00 \mathrm{~cm}$. The velocity is

$$
v=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{8.00 \mathrm{~cm}-2.00 \mathrm{~cm}}{3.00 \mathrm{~s}-0.00 \mathrm{~s}}=2.00 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}
$$

c. The period is $T=\frac{\lambda}{v}=\frac{8.00 \mathrm{~cm}}{2.00 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}}=4.00 \mathrm{~s}$ and the frequency is $f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{1}{4.00 \mathrm{~s}}=0.25 \mathrm{~Hz}$.

## Significance

Note that the wavelength can be found using any two successive identical points that repeat, having the same height and slope. You should choose two points that are most convenient. The displacement can also be found using any convenient point.

### 16.2 Mathematics of Waves

In the previous section, we described periodic waves by their characteristics of wavelength, period, amplitude, and wave speed of the wave. Waves can also be described by the motion of the particles of the medium through which the waves move. The position of particles of the medium can be mathematically modeled as wave functions, which can be used to find the position, velocity, and acceleration of the particles of the medium of the wave at any time.

## Pulses

A pulse can be described as wave consisting of a single disturbance that moves through the medium with a constant amplitude. The pulse moves as a pattern that maintains its shape as it propagates with a constant wave speed. Because the wave speed is constant, the distance the pulse moves in a time $\Delta t$ is equal to $\Delta x=v \Delta t$ (Figure 16.8).

## Modeling a One-Dimensional Sinusoidal Wave using a Wave Function

Consider a string kept at a constant tension $F_{T}$ where one end is fixed and the free end is oscillated between $y=+A$ and $y=-A$ by a mechanical device at a constant frequency. Figure 16.9 shows snapshots of the wave at an interval of an eighth of a period, beginning after one period $(t=T)$.

Notice that each select point on the string (marked by colored dots) oscillates up and down in simple harmonic motion, between $y=+A$ and $y=-A$, with a period $T$. The wave on the string is sinusoidal and is translating in the positive $x$-direction as time progresses.

At this point, it is useful to recall from your study of algebra that if $f(x)$ is some function, then $f(x-d)$ is the same function translated in the positive $x$-direction by a distance $d$. The function $f(x+d)$ is the same function translated in the negative $x$-direction by a distance $d$. We want to define a wave function that will give the $y$-position of each segment of the string for every position $x$ along the string for every time $t$.

Looking at the first snapshot in Figure 16.9, the $y$-position of the string between $x=0$ and $x=\lambda$ can be modeled as a sine function. This wave propagates down the string one wavelength in one period, as seen in the last snapshot. The wave therefore moves with a constant wave speed of $v=\lambda / T$.

Recall that a sine function is a function of the angle $\theta$, oscillating between +1 and -1 , and repeating every $2 \pi$ radians (Figure 16.10). However, the $y$-position of the medium, or the wave function, oscillates between $+A$ and $-A$, and repeats every wavelength $\lambda$.

To construct our model of the wave using a periodic function, consider the ratio of the angle and the position,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\theta}{x} & =\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \\
\theta & =\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} x
\end{aligned}
$$

Using $\theta=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} x$ and multiplying the sine function by the amplitude $A$, we can now model the $y$-position of the string as a function of the position $x$ :

$$
y(x)=A \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} x\right)
$$

The wave on the string travels in the positive $x$-direction with a constant velocity $v$, and moves a distance $v t$ in a time $t$. The wave function can now be defined by

$$
y(x, t)=A \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}(x-v t)\right)
$$

It is often convenient to rewrite this wave function in a more compact form. Multiplying through by the ratio $\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$ leads to the equation

$$
y(x, t)=A \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} x-\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} v t\right)
$$

The value $\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$ is defined as the wave number. The symbol for the wave number is $k$ and has units of inverse meters, $\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ :

$$
k \equiv \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}
$$

Recall from Oscillations that the angular frequency is defined as $\omega \equiv \frac{2 \pi}{T}$. The second term of the wave function becomes

$$
\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} v t=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}\left(\frac{\lambda}{T}\right) t=\frac{2 \pi}{T} t=\omega t
$$

The wave function for a simple harmonic wave on a string reduces to

$$
y(x, t)=A \sin (k x \mp \omega t)
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude, $k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, $\omega=\frac{2 \pi}{T}$ is the angular frequency, the minus sign is for waves moving in the positive $x$-direction, and the plus sign is for waves moving in the negative $x$-direction. The velocity of the wave is equal to

$$
v=\frac{\lambda}{T}=\frac{\lambda}{T}\left(\frac{2 \pi}{2 \pi}\right)=\frac{\omega}{k}
$$

Think back to our discussion of a mass on a spring, when the position of the mass was modeled as
$x(t)=A \cos (\omega t+\phi)$. The angle $\phi$ is a phase shift, added to allow for the fact that the mass may have initial conditions other than $x=+A$ and $v=0$. For similar reasons, the initial phase is added to the wave function. The wave function modeling a sinusoidal wave, allowing for an initial phase shift $\phi$, is

$$
y(x, t)=A \sin (k x \mp \omega t+\phi)
$$

The value

$$
(k x \mp \omega t+\phi)
$$

is known as the phase of the wave, where $\phi$ is the initial phase of the wave function. Whether the temporal term $\omega t$ is negative or positive depends on the direction of the wave. First consider the minus sign for a wave with an initial phase equal to zero $(\phi=0)$. The phase of the wave would be $(k x-\omega t)$. Consider following a point on a wave, such as a crest. A crest will occur when $\sin (k x-\omega t)=1.00$, that is, when $k x-\omega t=n \pi+\frac{\pi}{2}$, for any integral value of $n$. For instance, one particular crest occurs at $k x-\omega t=\frac{\pi}{2}$. As the wave moves, time increases and $x$ must also increase to keep the phase equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the minus sign is for a wave moving in the positive $x$-direction. Using the plus sign, $k x+\omega t=\frac{\pi}{2}$. As time increases, $x$ must decrease to keep the phase equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}$. The plus sign is used for waves moving in the negative $x$-direction. In summary, $y(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)$ models a wave moving in the positive $x$-direction and $y(x, t)=A \sin (k x+\omega t+\phi)$ models a wave moving in the negative $x$-direction.

Equation 16.4 is known as a simple harmonic wave function. A wave function is any function such that $f(x, t)=f(x-v t)$. Later in this chapter, we will see that it is a solution to the linear wave equation. Note that $y(x, t)=A \cos \left(k x+\omega t+\phi^{\prime}\right)$ works equally well because it corresponds to a different phase shift $\phi^{\prime}=\phi-\frac{\pi}{2}$.

## PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

## Finding the Characteristics of a Sinusoidal Wave

1. To find the amplitude, wavelength, period, and frequency of a sinusoidal wave, write down the wave function in the form $y(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)$.
2. The amplitude can be read straight from the equation and is equal to $A$.
3. The period of the wave can be derived from the angular frequency $\left(T=\frac{2 \pi}{\omega}\right)$.
4. The frequency can be found using $f=\frac{1}{T}$.
5. The wavelength can be found using the wave number $\left(\lambda=\frac{2 \pi}{k}\right)$.

## EXAMPLE 16.3

## Characteristics of a Traveling Wave on a String

A transverse wave on a taut string is modeled with the wave function

$$
y(x, t)=A \sin (k x-w t)=0.2 \mathrm{~m} \sin \left(6.28 \mathrm{~m}^{-1} x-1.57 \mathrm{~s}^{-1} t\right)
$$

Find the amplitude, wavelength, period, and speed of the wave.

## Strategy

All these characteristics of the wave can be found from the constants included in the equation or from simple combinations of these constants.

## Solution

1. The amplitude, wave number, and angular frequency can be read directly from the wave equation:

$$
y(x, t)=A \sin (k x-w t)=0.2 \mathrm{~m} \sin \left(6.28 \mathrm{~m}^{-1} x-1.57 \mathrm{~s}^{-1} t\right)
$$

$$
\left(A=0.2 \mathrm{~m} ; k=6.28 \mathrm{~m}^{-1} ; \omega=1.57 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)
$$

2. The wave number can be used to find the wavelength:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \\
& \lambda=\frac{2 \pi}{k}=\frac{2 \pi}{6.28 \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=1.0 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

3. The period of the wave can be found using the angular frequency:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \omega=\frac{2 \pi}{T} \\
& T=\frac{2 \pi}{\omega}=\frac{2 \pi}{1.57 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}=4 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$$

4. The speed of the wave can be found using the wave number and the angular frequency. The direction of the wave can be determined by considering the sign of $k x \mp \omega t$ : A negative sign suggests that the wave is moving in the positive $x$-direction:

$$
|v|=\frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{1.57 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{6.28 \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=0.25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

## Significance

All of the characteristics of the wave are contained in the wave function. Note that the wave speed is the speed of the wave in the direction parallel to the motion of the wave. Plotting the height of the medium $y$ versus the position $x$ for two times $t=0.00 \mathrm{~s}$ and $t=0.80 \mathrm{~s}$ can provide a graphical visualization of the wave (Figure 16.11).

There is a second velocity to the motion. In this example, the wave is transverse, moving horizontally as the medium oscillates up and down perpendicular to the direction of motion. The graph in Figure 16.12 shows the motion of the medium at point $x=0.60 \mathrm{~m}$ as a function of time. Notice that the medium of the wave oscillates up and down between $y=+0.20 \mathrm{~m}$ and $y=-0.20 \mathrm{~m}$ every period of 4.0 seconds.

## Velocity and Acceleration of the Medium

As seen in Example 16.4, the wave speed is constant and represents the speed of the wave as it propagates through the medium, not the speed of the particles that make up the medium. The particles of the medium oscillate around an equilibrium position as the wave propagates through the medium. In the case of the transverse wave propagating in the $x$-direction, the particles oscillate up and down in the $y$-direction, perpendicular to the motion of the wave. The velocity of the particles of the medium is not constant, which means there is an acceleration. The velocity of the medium, which is perpendicular to the wave velocity in a transverse wave, can be found by taking the partial derivative of the position equation with respect to time. The partial derivative is found by taking the derivative of the function, treating all variables as constants, except for the variable in question. In the case of the partial derivative with respect to time $t$, the position $x$ is treated as a constant. Although this may sound strange if you haven't seen it before, the object of this exercise is to find the transverse velocity at a point, so in this sense, the $x$-position is not changing. We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) & =A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi) \\
v_{y}(x, t) & =\frac{\partial y(x, t)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)) \\
& =-A \omega \cos (k x-\omega t+\phi) \\
& =-v_{y} \max \cos (k x-\omega t+\phi)
\end{aligned}
$$

The magnitude of the maximum velocity of the medium is $\left|v_{y_{\max }}\right|=A \omega$. This may look familiar from the Oscillations and a mass on a spring.

We can find the acceleration of the medium by taking the partial derivative of the velocity equation with respect to time,

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{y}(x, t) & =\frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(-A \omega \cos (k x-\omega t+\phi)) \\
& =-A \omega^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi) \\
& =-a_{y \max } \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)
\end{aligned}
$$

The magnitude of the maximum acceleration is $\left|a_{y_{\max }}\right|=A \omega^{2}$. The particles of the medium, or the mass elements, oscillate in simple harmonic motion for a mechanical wave.

## The Linear Wave Equation

We have just determined the velocity of the medium at a position $x$ by taking the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the position $y$. For a transverse wave, this velocity is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. We found the acceleration by taking the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the velocity, which is the second time derivative of the position:

$$
a_{y}(x, t)=\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}}=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}(A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi))=-A \omega^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)
$$

Now consider the partial derivatives with respect to the other variable, the position $x$, holding the time constant. The first derivative is the slope of the wave at a point $x$ at a time $t$,

$$
\text { slope }=\frac{\partial y(x, t)}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi))=A k \cos (k x-\omega t+\phi)
$$

The second partial derivative expresses how the slope of the wave changes with respect to position-in other words, the curvature of the wave, where

$$
\text { curvature }=\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}(A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi))=-A k^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)
$$

The ratio of the acceleration and the curvature leads to a very important relationship in physics known as the linear wave equation. Taking the ratio and using the equation $v=\omega / k$ yields the linear wave equation (also known simply as the wave equation or the equation of a vibrating string),

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}}}{\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}}} & =\frac{-A \omega^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)}{-A k^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)} \\
& =\frac{\omega^{2}}{k^{2}}=v^{2} \\
\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}} & =\frac{1}{v^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation 16.6 is the linear wave equation, which is one of the most important equations in physics and engineering. We derived it here for a transverse wave, but it is equally important when investigating longitudinal waves. This relationship was also derived using a sinusoidal wave, but it successfully describes any wave or pulse that has the form $y(x, t)=f(x \mp v t)$. These waves result due to a linear restoring force of the medium-thus, the name linear wave equation. Any wave function that satisfies this equation is a linear wave function.

An interesting aspect of the linear wave equation is that if two wave functions are individually solutions to the linear wave equation, then the sum of the two linear wave functions is also a solution to the wave equation. Consider two transverse waves that propagate along the $x$-axis, occupying the same medium. Assume that the individual waves can be modeled with the wave functions $y_{1}(x, t)=f(x \mp v t)$ and $y_{2}(x, t)=g(x \mp v t)$, which are solutions to the linear wave equations and are therefore linear wave functions. The sum of the wave functions is the wave function

$$
y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t)=f(x \mp v t)+g(x \mp v t)
$$

Consider the linear wave equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^{2}(f+g)}{\partial x^{2}} & =\frac{1}{v^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2}(f+g)}{\partial t^{2}} \\
\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} g}{\partial x^{2}} & =\frac{1}{v^{2}}\left[\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial t^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} g}{\partial t^{2}}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

This has shown that if two linear wave functions are added algebraically, the resulting wave function is also linear. This wave function models the displacement of the medium of the resulting wave at each position along the $x$-axis. If two linear waves occupy the same medium, they are said to interfere. If these waves can be modeled with a linear wave function, these wave functions add to form the wave equation of the wave resulting from the interference of the individual waves. The displacement of the medium at every point of the resulting wave is the algebraic sum of the displacements due to the individual waves.

Taking this analysis a step further, if wave functions $y_{1}(x, t)=f(x \mp v t)$ and $y_{2}(x, t)=g(x \mp v t)$ are solutions to the linear wave equation, then $A y_{1}(x, t)+B y_{2}(x, t)$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants, is also a solution to the linear wave equation. This property is known as the principle of superposition. Interference and superposition are covered in more detail in $\underline{\text { Interference of Waves. }}$

## EXAMPLE 16.4

## Interference of Waves on a String

Consider a very long string held taut by two students, one on each end. Student A oscillates the end of the string producing a wave modeled with the wave function $y_{1}(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t)$ and student $\mathrm{B}$ oscillates the string producing at twice the frequency, moving in the opposite direction. Both waves move at the same speed $v=\frac{\omega}{k}$. The two waves interfere to form a resulting wave whose wave function is $y_{R}(x, t)=y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t)$.

Find the velocity of the resulting wave using the linear wave equation $\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{1}{v^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}}$.

## Strategy

First, write the wave function for the wave created by the second student. Note that the angular frequency of the second wave is twice the frequency of the first wave $(2 \omega)$, and since the velocity of the two waves are the same, the wave number of the second wave is twice that of the first wave $(2 k)$. Next, write the wave equation for the resulting wave function, which is the sum of the two individual wave functions. Then find the second partial derivative with respect to position and the second partial derivative with respect to time. Use the linear wave equation to find the velocity of the resulting wave.

## Solution

1. Write the wave function of the second wave: $y_{2}(x, t)=A \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t)$.
2. Write the resulting wave function:

$$
y_{R}(x, t)=y_{1}(x, t)+y(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t)+A \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t)
$$

3. Find the partial derivatives:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial y_{R}(x, t)}{\partial x} & =-A k \cos (k x-\omega t)+2 A k \cos (2 k x+2 \omega t) \\
\frac{\partial^{2} y_{R}(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}} & =-A k^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t)-4 A k^{2} \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t) \\
\frac{\partial y_{R}(x, t)}{\partial t} & =-A \omega \cos (k x-\omega t)+2 A \omega \cos (2 k x+2 \omega t) \\
\frac{\partial^{2} y_{R}(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}} & =-A \omega^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t)-4 A \omega^{2} \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t)
\end{aligned}
$$

4. Use the wave equation to find the velocity of the resulting wave:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}} & =\frac{1}{v^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}} \\
-A k^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t)-4 A k^{2} \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t) & =\frac{1}{v^{2}}\left(-A \omega^{2} \sin (k x-\omega t)-4 A \omega^{2} \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t)\right) \\
k^{2}(-A \sin (k x-\omega t)-4 A \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t)) & =\frac{\omega^{2}}{v^{2}}(-A \sin (k x-\omega t)-4 A \sin (2 k x+2 \omega t)) \\
k^{2} & =\frac{\omega^{2}}{v^{2}},|v|=\frac{\omega}{k}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

The speed of the resulting wave is equal to the speed of the original waves $\left(v=\frac{\omega}{k}\right)$. We will show in the next section that the speed of a simple harmonic wave on a string depends on the tension in the string and the mass per length of the string. For this reason, it is not surprising that the component waves as well as the resultant wave all travel at the same speed.

### 16.3 Wave Speed on a Stretched String

The speed of a wave depends on the characteristics of the medium. For example, in the case of a guitar, the strings vibrate to produce the sound. The speed of the waves on the strings, and the wavelength, determine the frequency of the sound produced. The strings on a guitar have different thickness but may be made of similar material. They have different linear densities, where the linear density is defined as the mass per length,

$$
\mu=\frac{\text { mass of string }}{\text { length of string }}=\frac{m}{l}
$$

In this chapter, we consider only string with a constant linear density. If the linear density is constant, then the mass $(\Delta m)$ of a small length of string $(\Delta x)$ is $\Delta m=\mu \Delta x$. For example, if the string has a length of $2.00 \mathrm{~m}$ and a mass of $0.06 \mathrm{~kg}$, then the linear density is $\mu=\frac{0.06 \mathrm{~kg}}{2.00 \mathrm{~m}}=0.03 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}}$. If a $1.00-\mathrm{mm}$ section is cut from the string, the mass of the $1.00-\mathrm{mm}$ length is $\Delta m=\mu \Delta x=\left(0.03 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}}\right) 0.001 \mathrm{~m}=3.00 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~kg}$. The guitar also has a method to change the tension of the strings. The tension of the strings is adjusted by turning spindles, called the tuning pegs, around which the strings are wrapped. For the guitar, the linear density of the string and the tension in the string determine the speed of the waves in the string and the frequency of the sound produced is
proportional to the wave speed.

## Wave Speed on a String under Tension

To see how the speed of a wave on a string depends on the tension and the linear density, consider a pulse sent down a taut string (Figure 16.13). When the taut string is at rest at the equilibrium position, the tension in the string $F_{T}$ is constant. Consider a small element of the string with a mass equal to $\Delta m=\mu \Delta x$. The mass element is at rest and in equilibrium and the force of tension of either side of the mass element is equal and opposite.

If you pluck a string under tension, a transverse wave moves in the positive $x$-direction, as shown in Figure 16.14. The mass element is small but is enlarged in the figure to make it visible. The small mass element oscillates perpendicular to the wave motion as a result of the restoring force provided by the string and does not move in the $x$-direction. The tension $F_{T}$ in the string, which acts in the positive and negative $x$-direction, is approximately constant and is independent of position and time.

Assume that the inclination of the displaced string with respect to the horizontal axis is small. The net force on the element of the string, acting parallel to the string, is the sum of the tension in the string and the restoring force. The $x$-components of the force of tension cancel, so the net force is equal to the sum of the $y$-components of the force. The magnitude of the $x$-component of the force is equal to the horizontal force of tension of the string $F_{T}$ as shown in Figure 16.14. To obtain the $y$-components of the force, note that $\tan \theta_{1}=\frac{-F_{1}}{F_{T}}$ and $\tan \theta_{2}=\frac{F_{2}}{F_{T}}$. The $\tan \theta$ is equal to the slope of a function at a point, which is equal to the partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ at that point. Therefore, $\frac{F_{1}}{F_{T}}$ is equal to the negative slope of the string at $x_{1}$ and $\frac{F_{2}}{F_{T}}$ is equal to the slope of the string at $x_{2}$ :

$$
\frac{F_{1}}{F_{T}}=-\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{1}} \text { and } \frac{F_{2}}{F_{T}}=\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{2}}
$$

The net force is on the small mass element can be written as

$$
F_{\text {net }}=F_{1}+F_{2}=F_{T}\left[\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{2}}-\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{1}}\right]
$$

Using Newton's second law, the net force is equal to the mass times the acceleration. The linear density of the string $\mu$ is the mass per length of the string, and the mass of the portion of the string is $\mu \Delta x$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{T}\left[\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{2}}-\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{1}}\right]=\Delta m a \\
& F_{T}\left[\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{2}}-\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{1}}\right]=\mu \Delta x \frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial t^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Dividing by $\boldsymbol{F}_{T} \Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\Delta x$ approaches zero,

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\left[\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{2}}-\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{1}}\right]}{\Delta x}=\frac{\mu}{F_{T}} \frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial t^{2}} \\
\lim _{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\left[\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{2}}-\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{x_{1}}\right]}{\Delta x}=\frac{\mu}{F_{T}} \frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial t^{2}} \\
\frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{\mu}{F_{T}} \frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial t^{2}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Recall that the linear wave equation is

$$
\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{1}{v^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\frac{1}{v^{2}}=\frac{\mu}{F_{T}}
$$

Solving for $v$, we see that the speed of the wave on a string depends on the tension and the linear density.

## Speed of a Wave on a String Under Tension

The speed of a pulse or wave on a string under tension can be found with the equation

$$
|v|=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}
$$

where $F_{T}$ is the tension in the string and $\mu$ is the mass per length of the string.

## EXAMPLE 16.5

## The Wave Speed of a Guitar Spring

On a six-string guitar, the high E string has a linear density of $\mu_{\text {High }}=3.09 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}$ and the low $\mathrm{E}$ string has a linear density of $\mu_{\text {Low }} \mathrm{E}=5.78 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}$. (a) If the high $\mathrm{E}$ string is plucked, producing a wave in the string, what is the speed of the wave if the tension of the string is $56.40 \mathrm{~N}$ ? (b) The linear density of the low E string is approximately 20 times greater than that of the high E string. For waves to travel through the low E string at the same wave speed as the high E, would the tension need to be larger or smaller than the high E string? What would be the approximate tension? (c) Calculate the tension of the low E string needed for the same wave speed.

## Strategy

a. The speed of the wave can be found from the linear density and the tension $v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}$.

b. From the equation $v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}$, if the linear density is increased by a factor of almost 20 , the tension would
need to be increased by a factor of 20 .

c. Knowing the velocity and the linear density, the velocity equation can be solved for the force of tension $F_{T}=\mu v^{2}$.

## Solution

a. Use the velocity equation to find the speed:

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}=\sqrt{\frac{56.40 \mathrm{~N}}{3.09 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}}}=427.23 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

b. The tension would need to be increased by a factor of approximately 20 . The tension would be slightly less than $1128 \mathrm{~N}$.

c. Use the velocity equation to find the actual tension:

$$
F_{T}=\mu v^{2}=5.78 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}(427.23 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}=1055.00 \mathrm{~N}
$$

This solution is within $7 \%$ of the approximation.

## Significance

The standard notes of the six string (high E, B, G, D, A, low E) are tuned to vibrate at the fundamental frequencies $(329.63 \mathrm{~Hz}, 246.94 \mathrm{~Hz}, 196.00 \mathrm{~Hz}, 146.83 \mathrm{~Hz}, 110.00 \mathrm{~Hz}$, and $82.41 \mathrm{~Hz})$ when plucked. The frequencies depend on the speed of the waves on the string and the wavelength of the waves. The six strings have different linear densities and are "tuned" by changing the tensions in the strings. We will see in Interference of Waves that the wavelength depends on the length of the strings and the boundary conditions. To play notes other than the fundamental notes, the lengths of the strings are changed by pressing down on the strings.

## Speed of Compression Waves in a Fluid

The speed of a wave on a string depends on the square root of the tension divided by the mass per length, the linear density. In general, the speed of a wave through a medium depends on the elastic property of the medium and the inertial property of the medium.

$$
|v|=\sqrt{\frac{\text { elastic property }}{\text { inertial property }}}
$$

The elastic property describes the tendency of the particles of the medium to return to their initial position when perturbed. The inertial property describes the tendency of the particle to resist changes in velocity.

The speed of a longitudinal wave through a liquid or gas depends on the density of the fluid and the bulk modulus of the fluid,

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}
$$

Here the bulk modulus is defined as $B=-\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V / V_{0}}$, where $\Delta P$ is the change in the pressure and the denominator is the ratio of the change in volume to the initial volume, and $\rho \equiv \frac{m}{V}$ is the mass per unit volume. For example, sound is a mechanical wave that travels through a fluid or a solid. The speed of sound in air with an atmospheric pressure of $1.013 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ and a temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $v_{\mathrm{s}} \approx 343.00 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Because the density depends on temperature, the speed of sound in air depends on the temperature of the air. This will be
discussed in detail in $\underline{\text { Sound. }}$.

### 16.4 Energy and Power of a Wave

All waves carry energy, and sometimes this can be directly observed. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls (Figure 16.15). Loud sounds can pulverize nerve cells in the inner ear, causing permanent hearing loss. Ultrasound is used for deep-heat treatment of muscle strains. A laser beam can burn away a malignancy. Water waves chew up beaches.

In this section, we examine the quantitative expression of energy in waves. This will be of fundamental importance in later discussions of waves, from sound to light to quantum mechanics.

## Energy in Waves

The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude and its frequency. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground displacements. Loud sounds have high-pressure amplitudes and come from largeramplitude source vibrations than soft sounds. Large ocean breakers churn up the shore more than small ones. Consider the example of the seagull and the water wave earlier in the chapter (Figure 16.3). Work is done on the seagull by the wave as the seagull is moved up, changing its potential energy. The larger the amplitude, the higher the seagull is lifted by the wave and the larger the change in potential energy.

The energy of the wave depends on both the amplitude and the frequency. If the energy of each wavelength is considered to be a discrete packet of energy, a high-frequency wave will deliver more of these packets per unit time than a low-frequency wave. We will see that the average rate of energy transfer in mechanical waves is proportional to both the square of the amplitude and the square of the frequency. If two mechanical waves have equal amplitudes, but one wave has a frequency equal to twice the frequency of the other, the higherfrequency wave will have a rate of energy transfer a factor of four times as great as the rate of energy transfer of
the lower-frequency wave. It should be noted that although the rate of energy transport is proportional to both the square of the amplitude and square of the frequency in mechanical waves, the rate of energy transfer in electromagnetic waves is proportional to the square of the amplitude, but independent of the frequency.

## Power in Waves

Consider a sinusoidal wave on a string that is produced by a string vibrator, as shown in Figure 16.16. The string vibrator is a device that vibrates a rod up and down. A string of uniform linear mass density is attached to the rod, and the rod oscillates the string, producing a sinusoidal wave. The rod does work on the string, producing energy that propagates along the string. Consider a mass element of the string with a mass $\Delta m$, as seen in Figure 16.16. As the energy propagates along the string, each mass element of the string is driven up and down at the same frequency as the wave. Each mass element of the string can be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator. Since the string has a constant linear density $\mu=\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta x}$, each mass element of the string has the mass $\Delta m=\mu \Delta x$.

The total mechanical energy of the wave is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy $K=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$ of each mass element of the string of length $\Delta x$ is $\Delta K=\frac{1}{2}(\Delta m) v_{y}^{2}$, as the mass element oscillates perpendicular to the direction of the motion of the wave. Using the constant linear mass density, the kinetic energy of each mass element of the string with length $\Delta x$ is

$$
\Delta K=\frac{1}{2}(\mu \Delta x) v_{y}^{2}
$$

A differential equation can be formed by letting the length of the mass element of the string approach zero,

$$
d K=\lim _{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{2}(\mu \Delta x) v_{y}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(\mu d x) v_{y}^{2}
$$

Since the wave is a sinusoidal wave with an angular frequency $\omega$, the position of each mass element may be modeled as $y(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t)$. Each mass element of the string oscillates with a velocity $v_{y}=\frac{\partial y(x, t)}{\partial t}=-A \omega \cos (k x-\omega t)$. The kinetic energy of each mass element of the string becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
d K & =\frac{1}{2}(\mu d x)(-A \omega \cos (k x-\omega t))^{2} \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(\mu d x) A^{2} \omega^{2} \cos ^{2}(k x-\omega t)
\end{aligned}
$$

The wave can be very long, consisting of many wavelengths. To standardize the energy, consider the kinetic energy associated with a wavelength of the wave. This kinetic energy can be integrated over the wavelength to find the energy associated with each wavelength of the wave:

$$
\begin{aligned}
d K & =\frac{1}{2}(\mu d x) A^{2} \omega^{2} \cos ^{2}(k x) \\
\int_{0}^{K_{\lambda}} d K & =\int_{0}^{\lambda} \frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \cos ^{2}(k x) d x=\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \int_{0}^{\lambda} \cos ^{2}(k x) d x \\
K_{\lambda} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2}\left[\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{1}{4 k} \sin (2 k x)\right]_{0}^{\lambda}=\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2}\left[\frac{1}{2} \lambda+\frac{1}{4 k} \sin (2 k \lambda)-\frac{1}{4 k} \sin (0)\right] \\
K_{\lambda} & =\frac{1}{4} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

There is also potential energy associated with the wave. Much like the mass oscillating on a spring, there is a conservative restoring force that, when the mass element is displaced from the equilibrium position, drives the mass element back to the equilibrium position. The potential energy of the mass element can be found by considering the linear restoring force of the string, In Oscillations, we saw that the potential energy stored in a spring with a linear restoring force is equal to $U=\frac{1}{2} k_{s} x^{2}$, where the equilibrium position is defined as $x=0.00 \mathrm{~m}$. When a mass attached to the spring oscillates in simple harmonic motion, the angular frequency is equal to $\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k_{s}}{m}}$. As each mass element oscillates in simple harmonic motion, the spring constant is equal to $k_{s}=\Delta m \omega^{2}$. The potential energy of the mass element is equal to

$$
\Delta U=\frac{1}{2} k_{s} x^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \omega^{2} x^{2}
$$

Note that $k_{s}$ is the spring constant and not the wave number $k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$. This equation can be used to find the energy over a wavelength. Integrating over the wavelength, we can compute the potential energy over a wavelength:

$$
\begin{aligned}
d U & =\frac{1}{2} k_{s} x^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \mu \omega^{2} x^{2} d x \\
U_{\lambda} & =\frac{1}{2} \mu \omega^{2} A^{2} \int_{0}^{\lambda} \sin ^{2}(k x) d x=\frac{1}{4} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

The potential energy associated with a wavelength of the wave is equal to the kinetic energy associated with a wavelength.

The total energy associated with a wavelength is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E_{\lambda}=U_{\lambda}+K_{\lambda} \\
& E_{\lambda}=\frac{1}{4} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \lambda+\frac{1}{4} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \lambda=\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

The time-averaged power of a sinusoidal mechanical wave, which is the average rate of energy transfer associated with a wave as it passes a point, can be found by taking the total energy associated with the wave divided by the time it takes to transfer the energy. If the velocity of the sinusoidal wave is constant, the time for one wavelength to pass by a point is equal to the period of the wave, which is also constant. For a sinusoidal mechanical wave, the time-averaged power is therefore the energy associated with a wavelength divided by the period of the wave. The wavelength of the wave divided by the period is equal to the velocity of the wave,

$$
P_{\mathrm{ave}}=\frac{E_{\lambda}}{T}=\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} \frac{\lambda}{T}=\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} v
$$

Note that this equation for the time-averaged power of a sinusoidal mechanical wave shows that the power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave and to the square of the angular frequency of the wave. Recall that the angular frequency is equal to $\omega=2 \pi f$, so the power of a mechanical wave is equal to the square of the amplitude and the square of the frequency of the wave.

## EXAMPLE 16.6

## Power Supplied by a String Vibrator

Consider a two-meter-long string with a mass of $70.00 \mathrm{~g}$ attached to a string vibrator as illustrated in Figure 16.16. The tension in the string is $90.0 \mathrm{~N}$. When the string vibrator is turned on, it oscillates with a frequency of $60 \mathrm{~Hz}$ and produces a sinusoidal wave on the string with an amplitude of $4.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ and a constant wave speed. What is the time-averaged power supplied to the wave by the string vibrator?

## Strategy

The power supplied to the wave should equal the time-averaged power of the wave on the string. We know the
mass of the string $\left(m_{s}\right)$, the length of the string $\left(L_{s}\right)$, and the tension $\left(F_{T}\right)$ in the string. The speed of the wave on the string can be derived from the linear mass density and the tension. The string oscillates with the same frequency as the string vibrator, from which we can find the angular frequency.

## Solution

1. Begin with the equation of the time-averaged power of a sinusoidal wave on a string:

$$
P=\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} v
$$

The amplitude is given, so we need to calculate the linear mass density of the string, the angular frequency of the wave on the string, and the speed of the wave on the string.

2. We need to calculate the linear density to find the wave speed:

$$
\mu=\frac{m_{s}}{L_{s}}=\frac{0.070 \mathrm{~kg}}{2.00 \mathrm{~m}}=0.035 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}
$$

3. The wave speed can be found using the linear mass density and the tension of the string:

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}=\sqrt{\frac{90.00 \mathrm{~N}}{0.035 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}}}=50.71 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

4. The angular frequency can be found from the frequency:

$$
\omega=2 \pi f=2 \pi\left(60 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)=376.80 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

5. Calculate the time-averaged power:

$$
P=\frac{1}{2} \mu A^{2} \omega^{2} v=\frac{1}{2}\left(0.035 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}}\right)(0.040 \mathrm{~m})^{2}\left(376.80 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}\left(50.71 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)=201.59 \mathrm{~W}
$$

## Significance

The time-averaged power of a sinusoidal wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave and the square of the angular frequency of the wave. This is true for most mechanical waves. If either the angular frequency or the amplitude of the wave were doubled, the power would increase by a factor of four. The timeaveraged power of the wave on a string is also proportional to the speed of the sinusoidal wave on the string. If the speed were doubled, by increasing the tension by a factor of four, the power would also be doubled.

### 16.5 Interference of Waves

Up to now, we have been studying mechanical waves that propagate continuously through a medium, but we have not discussed what happens when waves encounter the boundary of the medium or what happens when a wave encounters another wave propagating through the same medium. Waves do interact with boundaries of the medium, and all or part of the wave can be reflected. For example, when you stand some distance from a rigid cliff face and yell, you can hear the sound waves reflect off the rigid surface as an echo. Waves can also interact with other waves propagating in the same medium. If you throw two rocks into a pond some distance from one another, the circular ripples that result from the two stones seem to pass through one another as they propagate out from where the stones entered the water. This phenomenon is known as interference. In this section, we examine what happens to waves encountering a boundary of a medium or another wave propagating in the same medium. We will see that their behavior is quite different from the behavior of particles and rigid bodies. Later, when we study modern physics, we will see that only at the scale of atoms do we see similarities in the properties of waves and particles.

## Reflection and Transmission

When a wave propagates through a medium, it reflects when it encounters the boundary of the medium. The wave before hitting the boundary is known as the incident wave. The wave after encountering the boundary is known as the reflected wave. How the wave is reflected at the boundary of the medium depends on the boundary conditions; waves will react differently if the boundary of the medium is fixed in place or free to move (Figure 16.17). A fixed boundary condition exists when the medium at a boundary is fixed in place so it cannot move. A free boundary condition exists when the medium at the boundary is free to move.

Part (a) of the Figure 16.17 shows a fixed boundary condition. Here, one end of the string is fixed to a wall so the end of the string is fixed in place and the medium (the string) at the boundary cannot move. When the wave is reflected, the amplitude of the reflected way is exactly the same as the amplitude of the incident wave, but the reflected wave is reflected $180^{\circ}(\pi \mathrm{rad})$ out of phase with respect to the incident wave. The phase change can be explained using Newton's third law: Recall that Newton's third law states that when object $A$ exerts a force on object $B$, then object $B$ exerts an equal and opposite force on object $A$. As the incident wave encounters the wall, the string exerts an upward force on the wall and the wall reacts by exerting an equal and opposite force on the string. The reflection at a fixed boundary is inverted. Note that the figure shows a crest of the incident wave reflected as a trough. If the incident wave were a trough, the reflected wave would be a crest.

Part (b) of the figure shows a free boundary condition. Here, one end of the string is tied to a solid ring of negligible mass on a frictionless pole, so the end of the string is free to move up and down. As the incident wave encounters the boundary of the medium, it is also reflected. In the case of a free boundary condition, the reflected wave is in phase with respect to the incident wave. In this case, the wave encounters the free boundary applying an upward force on the ring, accelerating the ring up. The ring travels up to the maximum height equal to the amplitude of the wave and then accelerates down towards the equilibrium position due to the tension in the string. The figure shows the crest of an incident wave being reflected in phase with respect to the incident wave as a crest. If the incident wave were a trough, the reflected wave would also be a trough. The amplitude of the reflected wave would be equal to the amplitude of the incident wave.

In some situations, the boundary of the medium is neither fixed nor free. Consider Figure 16.18(a), where a low-linear mass density string is attached to a string of a higher linear mass density. In this case, the reflected wave is out of phase with respect to the incident wave. There is also a transmitted wave that is in phase with respect to the incident wave. Both the transmitted and the reflected waves have amplitudes less than the amplitude of the incident wave. If the tension is the same in both strings, the wave speed is higher in the string with the lower linear mass density.

Part (b) of the figure shows a high-linear mass density string is attached to a string of a lower linear density. In this case, the reflected wave is in phase with respect to the incident wave. There is also a transmitted wave that is in phase with respect to the incident wave. Both the incident and the reflected waves have amplitudes less than the amplitude of the incident wave. Here you may notice that if the tension is the same in both strings, the wave speed is higher in the string with the lower linear mass density.

## Superposition and Interference

Most waves do not look very simple. Complex waves are more interesting, even beautiful, but they look formidable. Most interesting mechanical waves consist of a combination of two or more traveling waves propagating in the same medium. The principle of superposition can be used to analyze the combination of waves.

Consider two simple pulses of the same amplitude moving toward one another in the same medium, as shown in Figure 16.19. Eventually, the waves overlap, producing a wave that has twice the amplitude, and then continue on unaffected by the encounter. The pulses are said to interfere, and this phenomenon is known as interference.

To analyze the interference of two or more waves, we use the principle of superposition. For mechanical waves, the principle of superposition states that if two or more traveling waves combine at the same point, the resulting position of the mass element of the medium, at that point, is the algebraic sum of the position due to the individual waves. This property is exhibited by many waves observed, such as waves on a string, sound waves, and surface water waves. Electromagnetic waves also obey the superposition principle, but the electric and magnetic fields of the combined wave are added instead of the displacement of the medium. Waves that obey the superposition principle are linear waves; waves that do not obey the superposition principle are said to be nonlinear waves. In this chapter, we deal with linear waves, in particular, sinusoidal waves.

The superposition principle can be understood by considering the linear wave equation. In Mathematics of a Wave, we defined a linear wave as a wave whose mathematical representation obeys the linear wave equation. For a transverse wave on a string with an elastic restoring force, the linear wave equation is

$$
\frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{1}{v^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} y(x, t)}{\partial t^{2}}
$$

Any wave function $y(x, t)=y(x \mp v t)$, where the argument of the function is linear $(x \mp v t)$ is a solution to the linear wave equation and is a linear wave function. If wave functions $y_{1}(x, t)$ and $y_{2}(x, t)$ are solutions to the linear wave equation, the sum of the two functions $y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t)$ is also a solution to the linear wave equation. Mechanical waves that obey superposition are normally restricted to waves with amplitudes that are small with respect to their wavelengths. If the amplitude is too large, the medium is distorted past the region where the restoring force of the medium is linear.

Waves can interfere constructively or destructively. Figure 16.20 shows two identical sinusoidal waves that arrive at the same point exactly in phase. Figure 16.20 (a) and (b) show the two individual waves, Figure
16.20(c) shows the resultant wave that results from the algebraic sum of the two linear waves. The crests of the two waves are precisely aligned, as are the troughs. This superposition produces constructive interference. Because the disturbances add, constructive interference produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the individual waves, but has the same wavelength.

Figure 16.21 shows two identical waves that arrive exactly $180^{\circ}$ out of phase, producing destructive interference. Figure 16.21 (a) and (b) show the individual waves, and Figure 16.21(c) shows the superposition of the two waves. Because the troughs of one wave add the crest of the other wave, the resulting amplitude is zero for destructive interference-the waves completely cancel.

When linear waves interfere, the resultant wave is just the algebraic sum of the individual waves as stated in the principle of superposition. Figure 16.22 shows two waves (red and blue) and the resultant wave (black). The resultant wave is the algebraic sum of the two individual waves.

The superposition of most waves produces a combination of constructive and destructive interference, and can vary from place to place and time to time. Sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and quiet in another. Varying loudness means the sound waves add partially constructively and partially destructively at different locations. A stereo has at least two speakers creating sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these waves interfere, and the resulting wave is the superposition of the waves.

We have shown several examples of the superposition of waves that are similar. Figure 16.23 illustrates an example of the superposition of two dissimilar waves. Here again, the disturbances add, producing a resultant wave.

At times, when two or more mechanical waves interfere, the pattern produced by the resulting wave can be rich in complexity, some without any readily discernable patterns. For example, plotting the sound wave of your favorite music can look quite complex and is the superposition of the individual sound waves from many instruments; it is the complexity that makes the music interesting and worth listening to. At other times, waves can interfere and produce interesting phenomena, which are complex in their appearance and yet beautiful in simplicity of the physical principle of superposition, which formed the resulting wave. One example is the phenomenon known as standing waves, produced by two identical waves moving in different directions. We will look more closely at this phenomenon in the next section.

## Superposition of Sinusoidal Waves that Differ by a Phase Shift

Many examples in physics consist of two sinusoidal waves that are identical in amplitude, wave number, and angular frequency, but differ by a phase shift:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y_{1}(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi) \\
& y_{2}(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t)
\end{aligned}
$$

When these two waves exist in the same medium, the resultant wave resulting from the superposition of the two individual waves is the sum of the two individual waves:

$$
y_{R}(x, t)=y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)+A \sin (k x-\omega t)
$$

The resultant wave can be better understood by using the trigonometric identity:

$$
\sin u+\sin v=2 \sin \left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{u-v}{2}\right)
$$

where $u=k x-\omega t+\phi$ and $v=k x-\omega t$. The resulting wave becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{R}(x, t) & =y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t+\phi)+A \sin (k x-\omega t) \\
& =2 A \sin \left(\frac{(k x-\omega t+\phi)+(k x-\omega t)}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{(k x-\omega t+\phi)-(k x-\omega t)}{2}\right) \\
& =2 A \sin \left(k x-\omega t+\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation is usually written as

$$
y_{R}(x, t)=\left[2 A \cos \left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\right] \sin \left(k x-\omega t+\frac{\phi}{2}\right)
$$

The resultant wave has the same wave number and angular frequency, an amplitude of $A_{R}=\left[2 A \cos \left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\right]$, and a phase shift equal to half the original phase shift. Examples of waves that differ only in a phase shift are shown in Figure 16.24. The red and blue waves each have the same amplitude, wave number, and angular frequency, and differ only in a phase shift. They therefore have the same period, wavelength, and frequency. The green wave is the result of the superposition of the two waves. When the two waves have a phase difference of zero, the waves are in phase, and the resultant wave has the same wave number and angular frequency, and an amplitude equal to twice the individual amplitudes (part (a)). This is constructive interference. If the phase difference is $180^{\circ}$, the waves interfere in destructive interference (part (c)). The resultant wave has an amplitude of zero. Any other phase difference results in a wave with the same wave number and angular frequency as the two incident waves but with a phase shift of $\phi / 2$ and an amplitude equal to $2 A \cos (\phi / 2)$. Examples are shown in parts (b) and (d).

### 16.6 Standing Waves and Resonance

Throughout this chapter, we have been studying traveling waves, or waves that transport energy from one place to another. Under certain conditions, waves can bounce back and forth through a particular region, effectively becoming stationary. These are called standing waves.

Another related effect is known as resonance. In Oscillations, we defined resonance as a phenomenon in which a small-amplitude driving force could produce large-amplitude motion. Think of a child on a swing, which can be modeled as a physical pendulum. Relatively small-amplitude pushes by a parent can produce largeamplitude swings. Sometimes this resonance is good-for example, when producing music with a stringed instrument. At other times, the effects can be devastating, such as the collapse of a building during an earthquake. In the case of standing waves, the relatively large amplitude standing waves are produced by the superposition of smaller amplitude component waves.

## Standing Waves

Sometimes waves do not seem to move; rather, they just vibrate in place. You can see unmoving waves on the surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator, for example. Vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. Figure 16.25 shows an experiment you can try at home. Take a bowl of milk and place it on a common box fan. Vibrations from the fan will produce circular standing waves in the milk. The waves are visible in the photo due to the reflection from a lamp. These waves are formed by the superposition of two or more traveling waves, such as illustrated in Figure 16.26 for two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference. The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and, thus, is called a standing wave.

Consider two identical waves that move in opposite directions. The first wave has a wave function of $y_{1}(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t)$ and the second wave has a wave function $y_{2}(x, t)=A \sin (k x+\omega t)$. The waves
interfere and form a resultant wave

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y(x, t)=y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t) \\
& y(x, t)=A \sin (k x-\omega t)+A \sin (k x+\omega t)
\end{aligned}
$$

This can be simplified using the trigonometric identity

$$
\sin (\alpha \pm \beta)=\sin \alpha \cos \beta \pm \cos \alpha \sin \beta
$$

where $\alpha=k x$ and $\beta=\omega t$, giving us

$$
y(x, t)=A[\sin (k x) \cos (\omega t)-\cos (k x) \sin (\omega t)+\sin (k x) \cos (\omega t)+\cos (k x) \sin (\omega t)]
$$

which simplifies to

$$
y(x, t)=[2 A \sin (k x)] \cos (\omega t)
$$

Notice that the resultant wave is a sine wave that is a function only of position, multiplied by a cosine function that is a function only of time. Graphs of $y(x, t)$ as a function of $x$ for various times are shown in Figure 16.26. The red wave moves in the negative $x$-direction, the blue wave moves in the positive $x$-direction, and the black wave is the sum of the two waves. As the red and blue waves move through each other, they move in and out of constructive interference and destructive interference.

Initially, at time $t=0$, the two waves are in phase, and the result is a wave that is twice the amplitude of the individual waves. The waves are also in phase at the time $t=\frac{T}{2}$. In fact, the waves are in phase at any integer multiple of half of a period:

$$
t=n \frac{T}{2} \text { where } n=0,1,2,3 \ldots . \text { (in phase). }
$$

At other times, the two waves are $180^{\circ}(\pi$ radians) out of phase, and the resulting wave is equal to zero. This happens at

$$
t=\frac{1}{4} T, \frac{3}{4} T, \frac{5}{4} T, \ldots, \frac{n}{4} T \text { where } n=1,3,5 \ldots . \text { (out of phase). }
$$

Notice that some $x$-positions of the resultant wave are always zero no matter what the phase relationship is. These positions are called nodes. Where do the nodes occur? Consider the solution to the sum of the two waves

$$
y(x, t)=[2 A \sin (k x)] \cos (\omega t)
$$

Finding the positions where the sine function equals zero provides the positions of the nodes.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin (k x) & =0 \\
k x & =0, \pi, 2 \pi, 3 \pi, \ldots \\
\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} x & =0, \pi, 2 \pi, 3 \pi, \ldots \\
x & =0, \frac{\lambda}{2}, \lambda, \frac{3 \lambda}{2}, \ldots=n \frac{\lambda}{2} \quad n=0,1,2,3, \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

There are also positions where $y$ oscillates between $y= \pm A$. These are the antinodes. We can find them by considering which values of $x$ result in $\sin (k x)= \pm 1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin (k x) & = \pm 1 \\
k x & =\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3 \pi}{2}, \frac{5 \pi}{2}, \ldots \\
\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} x & =\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3 \pi}{2}, \frac{5 \pi}{2}, \ldots \\
x & =\frac{\lambda}{4}, \frac{3 \lambda}{4}, \frac{5 \lambda}{4}, \ldots=n \frac{\lambda}{4} \quad n=1,3,5, \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

What results is a standing wave as shown in Figure 16.27, which shows snapshots of the resulting wave of two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The resulting wave appears to be a sine wave with nodes at integer multiples of half wavelengths. The antinodes oscillate between $y= \pm 2 A$ due to the cosine term, $\cos (\omega t)$, which oscillates between $\pm 1$.

The resultant wave appears to be standing still, with no apparent movement in the $x$-direction, although it is composed of one wave function moving in the positive, whereas the second wave is moving in the negative $x$-direction. Figure 16.27 shows various snapshots of the resulting wave. The nodes are marked with red dots while the antinodes are marked with blue dots.

A common example of standing waves are the waves produced by stringed musical instruments. When the string is plucked, pulses travel along the string in opposite directions. The ends of the strings are fixed in place, so nodes appear at the ends of the strings-the boundary conditions of the system, regulating the resonant frequencies in the strings. The resonance produced on a string instrument can be modeled in a physics lab using the apparatus shown in Figure 16.28.

The lab setup shows a string attached to a string vibrator, which oscillates the string with an adjustable frequency $f$. The other end of the string passes over a frictionless pulley and is tied to a hanging mass. The magnitude of the tension in the string is equal to the weight of the hanging mass. The string has a constant linear density (mass per length) $\mu$ and the speed at which a wave travels down the string equals $v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}=\sqrt{\frac{m g}{\mu}}$ Equation 16.7. The symmetrical boundary conditions (a node at each end) dictate the possible frequencies that can excite standing waves. Starting from a frequency of zero and slowly increasing the frequency, the first mode $n=1$ appears as shown in Figure 16.29. The first mode, also called the fundamental mode or the first harmonic, shows half of a wavelength has formed, so the wavelength is equal to twice the length between the nodes $\lambda_{1}=2 L$. The fundamental frequency, or first harmonic frequency, that drives this mode is

$$
f_{1}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{v}{2 L}
$$

where the speed of the wave is $v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}$. Keeping the tension constant and increasing the frequency leads to the second harmonic or the $n=2$ mode. This mode is a full wavelength $\lambda_{2}=L$ and the frequency is twice the fundamental frequency:

The next two modes, or the third and fourth harmonics, have wavelengths of $\lambda_{3}=\frac{2}{3} L$ and $\lambda_{4}=\frac{2}{4} L$, driven by frequencies of $f_{3}=\frac{3 v}{2 L}=3 f_{1}$ and $f_{4}=\frac{4 v}{2 L}=4 f_{1}$. All frequencies above the frequency $f_{1}$ are known as the overtones. The equations for the wavelength and the frequency can be summarized as:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\lambda_{n}=\frac{2}{n} L \quad n=1,2,3,4,5 \ldots \\
f_{n}=n \frac{v}{2 L}=n f_{1} \quad n=1,2,3,4,5 \ldots
\end{gather*}
$$

The standing wave patterns that are possible for a string, the first four of which are shown in Figure 16.29, are known as the normal modes, with frequencies known as the normal frequencies. In summary, the first frequency to produce a normal mode is called the fundamental frequency (or first harmonic). Any frequencies above the fundamental frequency are overtones. The second frequency of the $n=2$ normal mode of the string is the first overtone (or second harmonic). The frequency of the $n=3$ normal mode is the second overtone (or third harmonic) and so on.

The solutions shown as Equation 16.15 and Equation 16.16 are for a string with the boundary condition of a node on each end. When the boundary condition on either side is the same, the system is said to have symmetric boundary conditions. Equation 16.15 and Equation 16.16 are good for any symmetric boundary conditions, that is, nodes at both ends or antinodes at both ends.

## Standing Waves on a String

Consider a string of $L=2.00 \mathrm{~m}$. attached to an adjustable-frequency string vibrator as shown in Figure 16.30. The waves produced by the vibrator travel down the string and are reflected by the fixed boundary condition at the pulley. The string, which has a linear mass density of $\mu=0.006 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}$, is passed over a frictionless pulley of a negligible mass, and the tension is provided by a $2.00-\mathrm{kg}$ hanging mass. (a) What is the velocity of the waves on the string? (b) Draw a sketch of the first three normal modes of the standing waves that can be produced on the string and label each with the wavelength. (c) List the frequencies that the string vibrator must be tuned to in order to produce the first three normal modes of the standing waves.

## Strategy

a. The velocity of the wave can be found using $v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}$. The tension is provided by the weight of the hanging mass.

b. The standing waves will depend on the boundary conditions. There must be a node at each end. The first mode will be one half of a wave. The second can be found by adding a half wavelength. That is the shortest length that will result in a node at the boundaries. For example, adding one quarter of a wavelength will result in an antinode at the boundary and is not a mode which would satisfy the boundary conditions. This is shown in Figure 16.31.

c. Since the wave speed velocity is the wavelength times the frequency, the frequency is wave speed divided by the wavelength.

## Solution

a. Begin with the velocity of a wave on a string. The tension is equal to the weight of the hanging mass. The linear mass density and mass of the hanging mass are given:

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}=\sqrt{\frac{m g}{\mu}}=\sqrt{\frac{2 \mathrm{~kg}\left(9.8 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)}{0.006 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}}}}=57.15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$

b. The first normal mode that has a node on each end is a half wavelength. The next two modes are found by adding a half of a wavelength.

c. The frequencies of the first three modes are found by using $f=\frac{v_{w}}{\lambda}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{1}=\frac{v_{w}}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{57.15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{4.00 \mathrm{~m}}=14.29 \mathrm{~Hz} \\
& f_{2}=\frac{v_{w}}{\lambda_{2}}=\frac{57.15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{2.00 \mathrm{~m}}=28.58 \mathrm{~Hz} \\
& f_{3}=\frac{v_{w}}{\lambda_{3}}=\frac{57.15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{1.333 \mathrm{~m}}=42.87 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Significance

The three standing modes in this example were produced by maintaining the tension in the string and adjusting the driving frequency. Keeping the tension in the string constant results in a constant velocity. The same modes could have been produced by keeping the frequency constant and adjusting the speed of the wave in the string (by changing the hanging mass.)
