## Friction and ballistics

### 3.1 Friction forces

Since friction is omnipresent in physical phenomena, it was considered until the $17^{\text {th }}$ century as a fundamental property and not as an interaction. Aristotle considered that every motion of an object could be attributed to the action of a force even when it was a linear uniform motion. The observation of the motion of the celestial bodies, for which the influence of friction is negligible, lead to the demise of the Aristotelian paradigm that has been replaced by the Newtonian paradigm.

Friction is due to the interaction between two systems that opposes their relative motion. Friction is characterised by phenomenological forces, i.e. forces that are inferred from experiment. The field of mechanics that studies friction is tribology. Friction is the result of different types of interactions that occur essentially at the microscopic scale. There are two types of friction : dry friction that occurs at the interface between solids and viscous friction of a solid immersed in a fluid - i.e. a liquid or a gas.

### 3.1.1 Dry friction

At the end of the $18^{\text {th }}$ century, Charles Augustin de Coulomb studied the action of a surface on a solid. He showed that there are two types of dry friction. The friction that prevents slipping of a solid with respect to another is called static friction. Friction that opposes slipping of a solid with respect to another and slows down its motion is called kinetic friction. At the beginning of the $16^{\text {th }}$ century. Leonardo da Vinci studied dry friction and

## Static friction

We consider a solid at rest laying on a surface (Fig. 3.1). It is subjected to a normal reaction force $\boldsymbol{N}$ that compensates its weight $\boldsymbol{P}$. A traction force $\boldsymbol{T}$ is exerted along the surface without setting the solid in motion. The solid is then subjected to a static friction

Figure 3.1 A wooden plate slides on a smooth and dry surface. Weights are placed on force $\boldsymbol{F}_{f}$ that compensates the traction force $\boldsymbol{T}$. It adjusts such that there is no slipping the wooden plate. The applied force is measured in the absence of slipping. Then it is measured while dragging the plate.

concluded that the friction force is proportional to the force exerted by the lower surface on the upper surface and that it is independent of the area of the contact surface. Two centuries later, Guillaume Amontons showed that it is also independent of the modulus of the relative velocity of one solid with respect to another.

When the static friction force $\boldsymbol{F}_{f}$ reaches a maximal value, it starts slipping. The expression of the norm $\left\|\boldsymbol{F}_{f}\right\|$ of the static friction force is given by an inequation established by de Coulomb,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left\|\boldsymbol{F}_{f}\right\| \leq \mu_{s}\|\boldsymbol{N}\| \tag{3.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\|\boldsymbol{N}\|$ is the norm of the normal reaction force $\boldsymbol{N}$ exerted by the surface on the solid and $\mu_{s}$ is a dimensionless positive number called the static friction coefficient. The value of this coefficient depends notably on the materials, on their surface state and on humidity.

## Kinetic friction

When the solid is set in motion it undergoes a kinetic friction force $\boldsymbol{F}_{f}$ that is opposed to the traction force $\boldsymbol{T}$ (Fig. 3.3). The expression of the norm $\left\|\boldsymbol{F}_{f}\right\|$ of the kinetic friction force
is given by an equation established by de Coulomb,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}_{f}=-\mu_{c}\|\boldsymbol{N}\| \hat{\boldsymbol{v}} \tag{3.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\hat{\boldsymbol{v}}=\boldsymbol{v} /\|\boldsymbol{v}\|$ is the dimensionless unit vector that is collinear to the velocity vector and $\mu_{c}$ is a dimensionless positive number called the kinetic friction coefficient. In this model, we consider that the coefficient $\mu_{c}$ is independent of the velocity.

We observe experimentally that the kinetic friction coefficient between two solids is smaller than the static friction coefficient, i.e. $\mu_{c}<\mu_{s}$ (Tab. 3.1). This is observed when a heavy element of furniture slips on a smooth ground. Before it is set in motion, in static regime, the norm $\left\|\boldsymbol{F}_{f}\right\|$ of the friction force is an increasing linear function of the norm $\|\boldsymbol{T}\|$ of the traction force. When it reaches the maximal value $\mu_{s}\|\boldsymbol{N}\|$, it begins moving. Then, the norm $\left\|\boldsymbol{F}_{f}\right\|$ of the friction force decreases rapidly in the kinetic regime to reach the constant value $\mu_{c}\|\boldsymbol{N}\|$ that is independent of the norm $\|\boldsymbol{T}\|$ of the traction force (Fig. 3.4).

### 3.1.2 Viscous friction

A viscous friction force is exerted on an object that moves in a fluid. It depends on the relative velocity $\boldsymbol{v}$ of the object with respect to the fluid. Two regimes have to be distinguished. The first is the regime of laminar flow that corresponds to a sufficiently slow relative speed. The second is the regime of turbulent flow that corresponds to a sufficiently high relative speed, that is slower than the propagation speed of sound.

## Stokes' law

In regime of laminar flow, the friction force is proportional to the relative velocity $\boldsymbol{v}$ and satisfies Stoke's law,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}_{f}=-k \eta \boldsymbol{v}=-b \boldsymbol{v} \tag{3.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $k$ is a geometric factor and $\eta$ is the fluid viscosity. In the case of a sphere, the geometric factor $k=6 \pi R$ where $R$ is the radius of the sphere. The viscosity $\eta$ that depends notably on the temperature represents a resistance to the flow (Tab. 3.2). The unit of the viscosity in the international system of units is denoted $\left[\mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right]$.

## Drag

In turbulent flow regime, the friction force is the drag that is proportional to the square of the relative speed $v^{2}$,

$$
\boldsymbol{F}_{f}=-\frac{1}{2} C_{x} A \rho v^{2} \hat{\boldsymbol{v}}
$$

where $C_{x}$ is the dimensionless drag coefficient, $A$ is the projected area of the object unto the plane that is orthogonal to the velocity vector and $\rho$ is the density of the fluid - i.e. the ratio of its mass and its volume. The drag coefficient is a coefficient that is entirely determined by the geometry of the object (Fig. 3.5).

The car history illustrates the evolution of the drag coefficient $C_{x}$. In the beginning of the $20^{\text {th }}$ century, cars had a drag coefficient $C_{x}=0.7-1.0$. Today, the most aerodynamical cars have a drag coefficient $C_{x}=0.2-0.3$ (Fig. 3.6). The drag coefficient has been reduced by

### 3.2 Ballistics without friction

After having set the foundations of newtonian mechanics and introduced different models for friction, we will now examine a practical application of these laws : ballistics. Ballistics is the study of the trajectories of objects, that can be assimilated to material points, when they are subjected to the gravitational attraction at the surface of the earth. Ballistics seeks to determine the position equation of a material point subjected to the gravitational force due to its own weight. When we speak of ballistics, we think straight away of a ball thrown in the air in the air or of the trajectory of a cannonball.

If a chalk is thrown with an initial velocity somewhere is a vertical plane, its trajectory is parabolic but if it is thrown vertically its trajectory is linear. To understand this, we have to establish the position equations of ballistics. First, we consider simple cases where friction can be neglected.

### 3.2.1 Problem solving

To solve a dynamical problem, it is useful to use a systematic approach. Using such an approach, we structure the mind and adopt a known methodology in foreign territory. This approach is not always necessarily the best, but it is certainly the most polyvalent. In the case of ballistics without friction, the step by step process is the following :

- We choose a frame of reference and a geometric frame - or a coordinate system. In the case of ballistic motion, there is no particular symmetry. Thus, we choose a Cartesian frame.
- We identify the external forces acting on the material point. In the case of ballistic
motion without friction, the only force acting on the material point is the gravitational force.
- We define the initial conditions on the positions and the velocity of the specific ballistic motion that we would like to describe.
- We state the vectorial law of motion - i.e. Newton's $2^{\text {nd }}$ law - in the case of ballistic motion.
- We project the vectorial law of motion on the coordinate axis. We obtain three equations of motion. These equations are differential equations expressed in terms of time derivatives of the components of the position.
- To obtain the position equations of the material point, we integrate the equations of motion over time. Combining these position equations, we obtain the equation for the trajectory of the object.


### 3.2.2 Weight

To study ballistics, we first need to define the gravitational force exerted on an object at the surface of the earth. The gravitational force exerted on an object is simply its weight. An object in free fall is subjected to an acceleration directed downwards due to the gravitational force. Thus, there exists a vectorial gravitational field denote $\boldsymbol{g}$. We use the term field, because the gravitational force acts everywhere, i.e. at every point. This field varies if the distance to the centre of the earth varies. It varies also with the latitude due to effects related to the rotation of the earth and due to the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere but has the shape of an ellipsoid. However, on the scale on which a ball is thrown or a cannonball is fired, these effects are negligible. Thus, we can consider here that the gravitational field is almost constant and directed towards the centre of the earth. The weight of an object is defined as the product of the mass $m$ of the object and the gravitational field $\boldsymbol{g}$ in agreement with Newton's $2^{\text {nd }}$ law (2.33),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{P}=m \boldsymbol{g} \tag{3.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The weight $\boldsymbol{P}$ is considered as an external force $\boldsymbol{F}^{\text {ext }}$ since the cause is the gravitational field that is external to the object. To find quantitative solutions to ballistics problems, we have to use a numerical value for this gravitational field. The experimental value of the norm of this field $\boldsymbol{g}$ evaluated at a latitude of $45^{\circ}$ at sea level is $g=9.81\left[\mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right]$.

### 3.2.3 Ballistic law of motion

After having established the expression (2.33) of Newton's $2^{\text {nd }}$ law and obtained the expression (3.5) of the weight, we can now establish the dynamical law of ballistic motion. The only external force $\boldsymbol{F}^{\text {ext }}$ is the weight of the object $\boldsymbol{P}$. Thus, the ballistic law of motion (2.33) is written,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}^{\mathrm{ext}}=\boldsymbol{P}=m \boldsymbol{a} \tag{3.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting the expression (3.5) of the weight into the equation of motion and dividing it by the mass $m$ of the object, we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
a=g \tag{3.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the acceleration of the object is constant and independent of its mass $m$. If we let a drop of water and a steel ball of the same volume fall, their accelerations are the same. Obviously, these objects have a different mass, but their acceleration is the same. This is observed only in the absence of friction or if friction is negligible. Galileo predicted and Torricelli observed that in vacuum a feather and a lead cube have the same acceleration

### 3.2.4 Frame and initial conditions

Since ballistic motion in the absence of friction has no particular symmetry, we choose as a frame the Cartesian frame $(O, x, y, z)$. The law of ballistic motion (3.7) describes all kinds of possible ballistic motions. To determine a specific ballistic motion, we have to specify the Cartesian coordinates of the position and velocity at a given time. To simplify, we specify in general the position and velocity at the initial time $t=0$. For this reason, we speak of initial conditions.

The initial position vector $\boldsymbol{r}(0)=\boldsymbol{r}_{0}$ is written in Cartesian coordinates as $(x(0), y(0), z(0))=\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right)$. Thus, there are three initial conditions on the position (Fig. 3.8)
(i) $\quad x(0)=x_{0}$
(ii) $\quad y(0)=y_{0}$
(iii) $\quad z(0)=z_{0}$

The initial velocity vector $\boldsymbol{v}(0)=\boldsymbol{v}_{0}$ is written in Cartesian coordinates as $(\dot{x}(0), \dot{y}(0), \dot{z}(0))=\left(v_{0 x}, v_{0 y}, v_{0 z}\right)$. Thus, there are three initial conditions on the velocity (Fig. 3.8),
(i) $\quad \dot{x}(0)=v_{0 x}$
(ii) $\quad \dot{y}(0)=v_{0 y}$
(iii) $\quad \dot{z}(0)=v_{0 z}$

### 3.2.5 Ballistic equations of motion

The acceleration vector is written in Cartesian coordinates as $\boldsymbol{a}=(\ddot{x}, \ddot{y}, \ddot{z})$. The gravitational field $\boldsymbol{g}$ is oriented downwards and is written in Cartesian coordinates $\boldsymbol{g}=(0,0,-g)$
where $g>0$. Projecting the vectorial law of motion (3.7) along the coordinate axes of the Cartesian frame, we obtain three scalar equations of motion,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \ddot{x}=0 \\
& \ddot{y}=0  \tag{3.10}\\
& \ddot{z}=-g=\mathrm{const}
\end{align*}
$$

Integrating the equations of motion (3.10) over time, taking into account the initial conditions (3.9) on the velocity, we obtain the velocity equations,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \dot{x}=v_{0 x}=\text { const } \\
& \dot{y}=v_{0 y}=\text { const }  \tag{3.11}\\
& \dot{z}(t)=-g t+v_{0 z}
\end{align*}
$$

Integrating the velocity equations (3.11) over time, taking into account the initial conditions (3.8) on the position, we obtain the position equations,

$$
\begin{align*}
& x(t)=v_{0 x} t+x_{0} \\
& y(t)=v_{0 y} t+y_{0}  \tag{3.12}\\
& z(t)=-\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}+v_{0 z} t+z_{0}
\end{align*}
$$

The motion along the coordinate axes $O x$ and $O y$ is a uniform linear motion because there is no force acting in these directions. The motion along the coordinate axis $O z$ is a uniformly accelerated motion downwards due to the gravitational field.

### 3.2.6 Free fall

We consider the free fall of a material point along the $O z$ axis from an initial position $\boldsymbol{r}_{0}=(0,0, h)$, where $h$ is the initial height, with no initial velocity, i.e. $\boldsymbol{v}_{0}=\mathbf{0}$. At time $t=t_{c}$ when the material point hits the ground, i.e. $z\left(t_{c}\right)=0$, the third equation of ballistic motion (3.12) becomes,

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{1}{2} g t_{c}^{2}+h=0 \tag{3.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the free fall time is given by,

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{c}=\sqrt{\frac{2 h}{g}} \tag{3.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Alternatively, knowing the height $h$ and measuring the time $t_{c}$, we can determine experimentally the gravitational field $g$.

### 3.2.7 Ballistic trajectory

We consider the ballistic motion of a material point initially at the origin, i.e. $\boldsymbol{r}_{0}=(0,0,0)$, with an initial velocity contained in the vertical plane $O x z$ and oriented along a fire angle $\alpha$ with respect to the horizontal axis $O x$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{v}_{0}=\left(v_{0} \cos \alpha, 0, v_{0} \sin \alpha\right)$. Thus, the equations of ballistic motion (3.12) become (Fig. 3.9),

$$
\begin{align*}
& x(t)=v_{0} \cos \alpha t \\
& y(t)=0  \tag{3.15}\\
& z(t)=-\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}+v_{0} \sin \alpha t
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting the first equation of motion (3.15) into the third equation of motion, we eliminate explicitly the time parameter $t$ and we obtain the equation of the ballistic trajectory (Fig. 3.10),

$$
\begin{equation*}
z(x)=-\frac{1}{2} \frac{g}{v_{0}^{2} \cos ^{2} \alpha} x^{2}+\tan \alpha x \tag{3.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

As an example, we consider a mechanism that drops two balls simultaneously. The first ball has no initial velocity, thus it is in free fall. The second has an horizontal initial velocity due to the action of a spring and it follows a uniform linear motion along the horizontal axis and a uniformly accelerated motion along the vertical axis (Fig. 3.11). The two balls hit the ground at the same time, because they are subjected to the same vertical acceleration due to the gravitational field.

As another example, we consider an air cushion bench inclined such that the long edge is horizontal and that the short edge is inclined. A puck is dropped from the top right hand
corner of the table. Simultaneously, a puck is thrown from the bottom left corner of the table in the line of fire of the first with a specific speed. The two pucks collide at the bottom right hand corner of the table (Fig. 3.12).

### 3.3 Ballistics with friction

The friction exerted on an object moving through the air or in another fluid is viscous friction. In this section, we consider that the relative velocity between the object and the fluid is sufficiently low. Thus, the motion of the object occurs in a laminar flow regime. Similarly to the case of ballistics without friction, we consider that the object can be modelled as a material point. In the presence of friction, we follow an analogous approach to the analysis of the ballistics without friction. On the mathematical level, the integration of the equations of motion to obtain the velocity equations then the position equations is a bit more complicated. We will see that the velocity equations and the position equations are characterised by a damping time that is due to the presence of a viscous force.

### 3.3.1 Ballistic law of motion

For a ballistic motion in the presence of friction in a regime of laminar flow, the external forces $\boldsymbol{F}^{\text {ext }}$ are the weight of the object $\boldsymbol{P}$ and the viscous friction force $\boldsymbol{F}_{f}$ given by Stoke's law. Thus, the ballistic law of motion (2.33) is written,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum \boldsymbol{F}^{\mathrm{ext}}=\boldsymbol{P}+\boldsymbol{F}_{f}=m \boldsymbol{a} \tag{3.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting the expression (3.5) of the weight $\boldsymbol{P}$ and Stokes' law (3.3) into the law of motion (3.17), the latter becomes,

$$
\begin{equation*}
m \boldsymbol{a}=m \boldsymbol{g}-b \boldsymbol{v} \tag{3.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

Contrary to the ballistic law of motion without friction (3.7), the law of motion with friction (3.18) shows that the acceleration depends on the mass $m$ like in the case of the fall of a feather and of a lead mass in the presence of friction.

### 3.3.2 Frame and initial conditions

As in the case of ballistics without friction, we choose the Cartesian frame $(O, x, y, z)$. Initially, the material point is located at the origin $O$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{r}(0)=(0,0,0)$. Thus, there are three initial conditions on the position (Fig. 3.9),

$$
\begin{array}{llll}
\text { (i) } & x(0)=0 & \text { (ii) } \quad y(0)=0 & \text { (iii) } \quad z(0)=0 \tag{3.19}
\end{array}
$$

There are also three initial conditions on the velocity (Fig. 3.9),
(i) $\quad \dot{x}(0)=v_{0 x}$
(ii) $\dot{y}(0)=0$
(iii) $\quad \dot{z}(0)=v_{0 z}$

### 3.3.3 Ballistic equations of motion

The velocity vector is written in Cartesian coordinates $\boldsymbol{v}=(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z})=\left(v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}\right)$ and the acceleration vector is written $\boldsymbol{a}=(\ddot{x}, \ddot{y}, \ddot{z})=\left(\dot{v}_{x}, \dot{v}_{y}, \dot{v}_{z}\right)$. The gravitational field $\boldsymbol{g}$ is oriented downwards and is written in Cartesian coordinates $\boldsymbol{g}=(0,0,-g)$ where $g>0$. Projecting the vectorial law of motion (3.18) along the coordinate axes of the Cartesian frame, we obtain three scalar equations,

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
m \ddot{x}=-b \dot{x} & \text { or } & m \dot{v}_{x}=-b v_{x} \\
m \ddot{y}=-b \dot{y} & \text { or } & m \dot{v}_{y}=-b v_{y}  \tag{3.21}\\
m \ddot{z}=-b \dot{z}-m g & \text { or } & m \dot{v}_{z}=-b v_{z}-m g
\end{array}
$$

The damping time $\tau$ is defined as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tau=\frac{m}{b} \tag{3.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

This definition is consistent, because in the absence of friction, i.e. $b=0$, the damping time becomes infinite, i.e. $\tau \rightarrow \infty$. The ballistic equations of motion with friction (3.21) can be divided by the mass $m$ and recast as,

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{v}_{x} & =-\frac{1}{\tau} v_{x} \\
\dot{v}_{y} & =-\frac{1}{\tau} v_{y}  \tag{3.23}\\
\dot{v}_{z} & =-\frac{1}{\tau} v_{z}-g
\end{align*}
$$

Since the initial velocity vector $\boldsymbol{v}_{0}$ is contained in the vertical plane $O x z$, there is no ballistic motion along the horizontal axis $y$. The ballistic motion can be split into a horizontal motion along the axis $O x$ and a vertical motion along the axis $O z$. Now, we shall determine the velocity equation and then the position equation of the horizontal motion first and of the vertical motion thereafter.

### 3.3.4 Horizontal ballistic motion

The first equation of ballistic motion with friction (3.23) can be recast as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d v_{x}(t)}{v_{x}(t)}=-\frac{d t}{\tau} \tag{3.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

In order to obtain the velocity equation along the horizontal axis $O x$, we integrate the differential equation of motion (3.24) from the initial time 0 to the time $t$ and thus from the initial velocity $v_{0 x}$ to the velocity $v_{x}(t)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{v_{0 x}}^{v_{x}(t)} \frac{d v_{x}^{\prime}\left(t^{\prime}\right)}{v_{x}^{\prime}\left(t^{\prime}\right)}=-\frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{t} d t^{\prime} \tag{3.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the variables and functions appearing in the expression of the integrand are denoted with primes in order not to be confused with the integration bounds. The solution of the integral (3.25) is written,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ln \left(v_{x}(t)\right)-\ln \left(v_{0 x}\right)=\ln \left(\frac{v_{x}(t)}{v_{0 x}}\right)=-\frac{t}{\tau} \tag{3.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking the exponential of equation (3.26), we obtain the velocity equation (Fig. 3.13),

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{x}(t)=v_{0 x} \exp \left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right) \tag{3.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the velocity is the derivative (1.2) of the position, the infinitesimal horizontal displacement $d x(t)$ is given by,

$$
\begin{equation*}
d x(t)=v_{0 x} \exp \left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right) d t \tag{3.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

In order to obtain the position equation along the horizontal axis $O x$, we integrate the
displacement differential equation (3.24) from the initial time 0 to the time $t$ and thus from the initial position 0 to the position $x(t)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{x(t)} d x^{\prime}\left(t^{\prime}\right)=v_{0 x} \int_{0}^{t} \exp \left(-\frac{t^{\prime}}{\tau}\right) d t^{\prime} \tag{3.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

The solution of the integral equation (3.29) is written,

$$
\begin{equation*}
x(t)=-\left.v_{0 x} \tau \exp \left(-\frac{t^{\prime}}{\tau}\right)\right|_{t^{\prime}=0} ^{t^{\prime}=t} \tag{3.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

The position equation of the horizontal motion (3.30) can be recast as (Fig. 3.14),

$$
\begin{equation*}
x(t)=v_{0 x} \tau\left(1-\exp \left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right)\right) \tag{3.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

The position equation of the horizontal motion shows that the horizontal position coordinate tends towards a maximal value,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} x(t)=v_{0 x} \tau \tag{3.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.3.5 Vertical ballistic motion

In order to solve the vertical ballistic motion (3.23), we have to perform a change of variables to make this differential equation homogeneous, i.e. the derivative has to become proportional to the function. Using the change of variables,

$$
\begin{equation*}
u_{z}(t)=v_{z}(t)+g \tau \tag{3.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

the third equation of ballistic motion with friction (3.23) is written,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\dot{u}_{z}=-\frac{1}{\tau} u_{z} \tag{3.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (3.34) can be recast as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d u_{z}(t)}{u_{z}(t)}=-\frac{d t}{\tau} \tag{3.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

In order to obtain the velocity equation along the vertical axis $O z$, we integrate the differential equation of motion (3.35) from the initial time 0 to the time $t$ and thus from the initial velocity $u_{0 z}=v_{0 z}+g \tau$ to the velocity $u_{z}(t)=v_{z}(t)+g \tau$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{v_{0 z}+g \tau}^{v_{z}(t)+g \tau} \frac{d v_{z}^{\prime}\left(t^{\prime}\right)}{v_{z}^{\prime}\left(t^{\prime}\right)}=-\frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{t} d t^{\prime} \tag{3.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

The solution of the integral equation (3.36) is written,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ln \left(v_{z}(t)+g \tau\right)-\ln \left(v_{0 z}+g \tau\right)=\ln \left(\frac{v_{z}(t)+g \tau}{v_{0 z}+g \tau}\right)=-\frac{t}{\tau} \tag{3.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking the exponential of equation (3.37), we obtain the velocity equation (Fig. 3.15),

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{z}(t)=\left(v_{0 z}+g \tau\right) \exp \left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right)-g \tau \tag{3.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

The velocity equation of vertical motion shows that the vertical coordinate of the velocity tends towards a minimal value called terminal velocity $v_{l}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{l}=\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} v_{z}(t)=-g \tau \tag{3.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking into account the expression (3.22) of the damping time $\tau=m / b$ and of the coefficient $b=k \eta$ obtained by Stokes' law (3.3), the damping time is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity $\eta$, i.e. $\tau=m /(k \eta)$. Thus, the more viscous the liquid is, the shorter the damping time will be. A ball in free fall in oil is more quickly damped than in water. The terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity $\eta$, i.e. $v_{l}=-g \tau=$ $-m g /(k \eta)$. Thus, the more viscous the liquid is, the slower the terminal velocity will be. The terminal velocity of a ball in oil is slower than in water.

The terminal free fall velocity reached by a human in the atmosphere is of about 200 $\mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h}$ whereas the peregrine falcon reaches a terminal velocity of about $300 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$. At this speed, the flow of air occurs in a turbulent regime and the drag coefficient $C_{x}$ of the falcon is far better than that of a human.

Since the velocity is the derivative (1.2) of the position, the infinitesimal vertical displacement $d z(t)$ is given by,

$$
\begin{equation*}
d z(t)=\left(v_{0 z}+g \tau\right) \exp \left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right) d t-g \tau d t \tag{3.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

In order to obtain the position equation along the vertical axis $O z$, we integrate the displacement differential equation (3.40) from the initial time 0 to the time $t$ and thus from the initial position 0 to the position $z(t)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{z(t)} d z^{\prime}\left(t^{\prime}\right)=\left(v_{0 z}+g \tau\right) \int_{0}^{t} \exp \left(-\frac{t^{\prime}}{\tau}\right) d t^{\prime}-g \tau \int_{0}^{t} d t^{\prime} \tag{3.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

The solution of the integral equation (3.41) is written,

$$
\begin{equation*}
z(t)=-\left.\left(v_{0 z} \tau+g \tau^{2}\right) \exp \left(-\frac{t^{\prime}}{\tau}\right)\right|_{t^{\prime}=0} ^{t^{\prime}=t}-\left.g \tau t^{\prime}\right|_{t^{\prime}=0} ^{t^{\prime}=t} \tag{3.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

The position equation of the vertical motion (3.42) can be recast as (Fig. 3.16),

$$
\begin{equation*}
z(t)=\left(v_{0 z} \tau+g \tau^{2}\right)\left(1-\exp \left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right)\right)-g \tau t \tag{3.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.3.6 Ballistic trajectory

Substituting the equation of horizontal motion (3.31) into the equation of vertical motion (3.43), we eliminate explicitly the time parameter $t$ and we obtain the ballistic trajectory equation (Fig. 3.17),

$$
\begin{equation*}
z(x)=\left(v_{0 z}+g \tau\right) \frac{x}{v_{0 x}}+g \tau^{2} \ln \left(1-\frac{x}{v_{0 x} \tau}\right) \tag{3.44}
\end{equation*}
$$
