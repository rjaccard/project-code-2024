## Law of action-reaction, collisions

In chapter 2, we stated Newton's first two laws that determine the dynamics of a material point. In the first section of this chapter, we shall state Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law that determines the dynamical interaction between material points inside a system. In the second and third parts of this section, we will study the collisions between material points inside a system consisting of material points.

### 8.1 Law of action-reaction

Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law also called law of action-reaction describes the interaction between two or several material points. A set of two or several interacting material points is called a system of material points. In the case of a system of material points, we have to distinguish the external forces $\boldsymbol{F}_{\alpha}^{\text {ext }}$ exerted on the material points $P_{\alpha}$ by the exterior from the internal forces $\boldsymbol{F}_{\alpha}^{\text {int }}$ exerted on the material points $P_{\alpha}$ by the other material points of the system. Newton's first two laws are defined in terms of external forces applied on a material point. These laws remain valid for a system of material points.

### 8.1.1 Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law

Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law is stated by Newton in his Principia Mathematica in the following way :

To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction : or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.

In more modern words, we would simply say :

A material point 1 exerting a force $\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}$ on a material point 2 is subjected to a reaction force $\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}$ of equal norm but opposite direction exerted by the material point 2.

Thus, Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law is simply written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}+\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}=\mathbf{0} \tag{8.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 8.1.2 Internal and external forces

In order to illustrate the difference between internal and external forces, we consider a system consisting of two material points of equal mass joined by a rope of negligible mass going over two pulleys. If the masses are equal, the system is at equilibrium. We can virtually decompose the system into two parts. Obviously, the force $\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}$ exerted by the material point 2 on the rope is equal and opposite to the force $\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}$ exerted by the material point 1 on the rope according to Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law. Thus, the net action-reaction force vanishes (Fig. 8.1).

In the case of this system (Fig. 8.1), the internal forces are the tensions in the rope since these tensions $\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}$ and $\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}$ are generated by the masses that belong to the system. The external forces are the weights $\boldsymbol{P}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{P}_{2}$ of the masses that are due to the gravitational interaction of the earth that does not belong to the system.

The notion of internal and external forces depends on the choice of system of material points. For instance, if the system is the earth and a plane, then the weight of the plane is an internal force of the system. If the system is the plane without the earth, the weight is an external force. As another example of internal forces, let us mention the cohesion forces exerted between the atoms inside a solid.

### 8.1.3 Momentum conservation

A system of material points is isolated if there is no interaction with the exterior. In mechanics, there is no external force acting on an isolated system. We consider a system consisting of two interacting material points 1 and 2 . The momenta of the material points are $\boldsymbol{p}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{p}_{2}$ and the interaction forces exerted by a material point on the other are $\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}$ and $\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}$. The law of motion (2.33) applied separately to each subsystem consisting of a material point is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}=\frac{d \boldsymbol{p}_{1}}{d t} \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}=\frac{d \boldsymbol{p}_{2}}{d t} \tag{8.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking into account the laws of motion (8.2) and Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law (8.1), the variation of the total momentum of the system $\boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{p}_{1}+\boldsymbol{p}_{2}$ is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d \boldsymbol{p}}{d t}=\frac{d\left(\boldsymbol{p}_{1}+\boldsymbol{p}_{2}\right)}{d t}=\frac{d \boldsymbol{p}_{1}}{d t}+\frac{d \boldsymbol{p}_{2}}{d t}=\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}+\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}=\mathbf{0} \quad \text { thus } \quad \boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{p}_{1}+\boldsymbol{p}_{2}=\text { const } \tag{8.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, for an isolated system or for a system on which the net exerted force vanishes, the total momentum is conserved. This conservation law plays an important role in the study of collisions.

As an example, we can mention the motion of a man on a chariot. When the man climbs on the chariot, the two are initially at rest with respect to the inertial frame of reference of the auditorium, i.e. the total momentum of the system consisting of the man and the chariot vanishes. When the man moves towards the RHS, the chariot moves towards the LHS and vice versa in order for the total momentum of the system to remain zero according to the momentum conservation law (Fig. 8.2).

The second example is that of a chariot containing a cylinder filled with water that can move on a horizontal rail : water flows out of the bottom of the cylinder with a horizontal momentum at the exit. The momentum conservation law requires the chariot to move in the opposite direction to the water flow (Fig. 8.3). If a wagon is attached to the chariot and the water flows into the wagon, the flow of water is internal to the system and the system remains at rest.

### 8.2 Collisions

Collisions between material points are characterised by an impact that conserves the total momentum of the system. In general, for the simplest model, we can consider that the points are in uniform linear motion and that during a very short time span, when the impact occurs, the momentum is discontinuous.

Two types of collisions have to be distinguished, elastic collisions on one hand and inelastic collisions on the other hand. Elastic collisions conserve the kinetic energy of the system and inelastic collisions do not.

There are all kinds of collisions like the one between two pool balls or between fundamental particles in the detector of the CMS experiment of the LHC particle accelerator, i.e. Large Hadron Collider, at CERN.

### 8.2.1 Impulse

The duration of a collision can be measured by hitting a steel anvil or a lead block with a hammer. The electric circuit is closed when the hammer is in contact with the anvil or the block. The result is visualised on an oscilloscope. Since the anvil is harder than the block, the collision is shorter with the anvil than with the block because a harder material absorbs collisions less than a softer material (Fig. 8.4).

The duration of the impact between the hammer and the anvil or between the hammer and the lead block is sufficiently small so that we can reasonably consider that the momentum variation occurs during an infinitesimal time interval $d t$. The impulse $\boldsymbol{I}$ is defined as the momentum variation $d \boldsymbol{p}$ due to the action of the force $\boldsymbol{F}$ during the impact,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{I}=d \boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{F} d t \tag{8.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

taking into account Newton's $2^{\text {nd }}$ law. Let us consider a collision between two material points 1 and 2. According to definition (8.4), their impulse during the collision are given by,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{I}_{1}=d \boldsymbol{p}_{1}=\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1} d t \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{I}_{2}=d \boldsymbol{p}_{2}=\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2} d t \tag{8.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, taking into account Newton's $3^{r d}$ law, the total impulse $\boldsymbol{I}$ during the collision is given by,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{I}=\boldsymbol{I}_{1}+\boldsymbol{I}_{2}=\left(\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}+\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}\right) d t=\mathbf{0} \tag{8.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

which means that the total impulse vanishes during the collision, in agreement with the momentum conservation law.

As an example, let us mention the impulse transferred to a target by a gun bullet or the recoil of a glider on an air cushion bench when a projectile is fired (Fig. 8.5).

### 8.2.2 Elastic collision

We consider an elastic collision between two material points of mass $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ respectively. The first material point moves initially along the horizontal axis $O x$ and the second material point is initially at rest, thus its initial momentum vanishes, i.e. $\boldsymbol{p}_{2 i}=\mathbf{0}$, in the chosen inertial frame of reference (Fig. 8.6). This elastic collision is characterised by the conservation law of the total momentum $\boldsymbol{p}$ and of the total kinetic energy $T$ of the system. The balance equations for the momentum and the kinetic energy just before and just after the collision are written as,

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\boldsymbol{p}_{1 i}+\boldsymbol{p}_{2 i}=\boldsymbol{p}_{1 f}+\boldsymbol{p}_{2 f} & \text { where } & \boldsymbol{p}_{2 i}=\mathbf{0} \\
T_{1 i}+T_{2 i}=T_{1 f}+T_{2 f} & \text { where } & T_{2 i}=0 \tag{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_18_8d29ab88ccb2d80a08d0g-04.jpg?height=49&width=77&top_left_y=2307&top_left_x=1796}
\end{array}
$$

The projections of the momentum conservation law (8.7) along the axis $O x$ and $O y$ are written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{1 i}=p_{1 f} \cos \theta_{1}+p_{2 f} \cos \theta_{2} \quad \text { and } \quad 0=p_{1 f} \sin \theta_{1}-p_{2 f} \sin \theta_{2} \tag{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_18_8d29ab88ccb2d80a08d0g-04.jpg?height=45&width=77&top_left_y=2536&top_left_x=1796}
\end{equation*}
$$

Squaring equations (8.9), we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(p_{1 i}-p_{1 f} \cos \theta_{1}\right)^{2}=p_{2 f}^{2} \cos ^{2} \theta_{2} \quad \text { and } \quad p_{1 f}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta_{1}=p_{2 f}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta_{2} \tag{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_18_8d29ab88ccb2d80a08d0g-04.jpg?height=43&width=91&top_left_y=2673&top_left_x=1776}
\end{equation*}
$$

The sum of equations (8.10) is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(p_{1 i}-p_{1 f} \cos \theta_{1}\right)^{2}+p_{1 f}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta_{1}=p_{2 f}^{2} \tag{8.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the kinetic energy reads $T=m \boldsymbol{v}^{2} / 2=\boldsymbol{p}^{2} / 2 m$, the kinetic energy conservation law (8.8) can be expressed as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{p_{1 i}^{2}}{2 m_{1}}=\frac{p_{1 f}^{2}}{2 m_{1}}+\frac{p_{2 f}^{2}}{2 m_{2}} \quad \text { thus } \quad p_{2 f}^{2}=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}\left(p_{1 i}^{2}-p_{1 f}^{2}\right) \tag{8.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

The identification of equations (8.11) and (8.12) yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(1+\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}\right) p_{1 f}^{2}-2 p_{1 i} p_{1 f} \cos \theta_{1}+\left(1-\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}\right) p_{1 i}^{2}=0 \tag{8.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

Dividing equation (8.13) by $p_{1 i}^{2}$, we obtain a $2^{e}$ degree equation in $p_{1 f} / p_{1 i}$. The solutions of this equation are,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{p_{1 f}}{p_{1 i}}=\frac{m_{1} v_{1 f}}{m_{1} v_{1 i}}=\frac{v_{1 f}}{v_{1 i}}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\left\{\cos \theta_{1} \pm \sqrt{\cos ^{2} \theta_{1}-\left(1-\frac{m_{2}^{2}}{m_{1}^{2}}\right)}\right\} \tag{8.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

## Equal masses

We consider the particular case where the masses are equal, i.e. $m_{1}=m_{2}$. In this case, the momentum conservation law (8.7) and the kinetic energy conservation law (8.8) reduce to,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \boldsymbol{v}_{1 i}=\boldsymbol{v}_{1 f}+\boldsymbol{v}_{2 f}  \tag{8.15}\\
& \boldsymbol{v}_{1 i}^{2}=\boldsymbol{v}_{1 f}^{2}+\boldsymbol{v}_{2 f}^{2} \tag{8.16}
\end{align*}
$$

Squaring equation (8.15), we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{v}_{1 i}^{2}=\boldsymbol{v}_{1 f}^{2}+2 \boldsymbol{v}_{1 f} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}_{2 f}+\boldsymbol{v}_{2 f}^{2} \tag{8.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

The difference between equations (8.17) and (8.16) reduces to the condition,

$$
\boldsymbol{v}_{1 f} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}_{2 f}=0 \quad \text { thus } \quad\left\{\begin{array}{llll}
\text { if } & \boldsymbol{v}_{1 f} \neq \mathbf{0} & \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{v}_{2 f} \neq \mathbf{0}  \tag{8.18}\\
\text { if } & \boldsymbol{v}_{1 f}=\mathbf{0} & \text { then } & \boldsymbol{v}_{2 f}=\boldsymbol{v}_{1 i}
\end{array}\right.
$$

As an example, we can mention the collision between two pucks of equal mass on a horizontal air cushion table (Fig. 8.7). Actually, in this case the angle between the pucks is slightly inferior to $90^{\circ}$ due to the intrinsic rotation of the pucks.

## Linear collision

We consider a linear elastic collision, i.e. $\theta_{1}=\theta_{2}=0$. For such a collision, $\cos \theta_{1}=\cos \theta_{2}=$ 1 , and equation (8.14) reduces to,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{v_{1 f}}{v_{1 i}}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\left\{1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{m_{2}^{2}}{m_{1}^{2}}}\right\}=\frac{m_{1} \pm m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} \tag{8.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

The mathematical solution (8.19) with the + sign has to be rejected because if the final speed $v_{1 f}$ of the material point would be equal to its initial speed $v_{1 i}$, this would mean that there has been no collision! Thus, the physical solution is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{1 f}=\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1 i} \tag{8.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

The expression (8.12) of the kinetic energy conservation can be recast as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1 i}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1 f}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2 f}^{2} \quad \text { thus } \quad v_{2 f}^{2}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{2}}\left(v_{1 i}^{2}-v_{1 f}^{2}\right) \tag{8.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substituting equation (8.20) into equation (8.21) and then taking the square root, we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{2 f}=\frac{2 m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1 i} \tag{8.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using expressions (8.20) and (8.22), we examine now two particular cases of linear collisions :

1) equal masses : $m_{1}=m_{2} \quad$ thus $\quad v_{1 f}=0 \quad$ and $\quad v_{2 f}=v_{1 i}$
2) infinite mass : $m_{1} / m_{2} \rightarrow 0$ thus $\quad v_{2 f}=0 \quad$ and $\quad v_{1 f}=-v_{1 i}$

The first case corresponds to the linear collision between two pool balls or between two metallic balls of same mass, and also to the elastic collision between two pucks of equal mass on a horizontal air cushion table or between two glider of equal mass on a horizontal air cushion bench (Fig. 8.8). The second case corresponds to the elastic collision between a free falling ball and the ground or between a molecule and the inside wall of a container.

### 8.2.3 Perfectly inelastic collision

A perfectly inelastic collision between two material points is a collision where the two material points remain attached to each other afterwards. Such a collision causes a loss
of kinetic energy. We consider a perfectly inelastic collision between two material points of mass $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ respectively. The first material point moves initially along an horizontal axis $O x$ and the second material point is initially at rest, thus its momentum vanishes, i.e. $\boldsymbol{p}_{2}=\mathbf{0}$, and its kinetic energy also, i.e. $T_{2}=0$, in the chosen inertial frame of reference. After collision, the total momentum of the system is $\boldsymbol{p}_{f}$ and the total kinetic energy is $T_{f}$ (Fig. 8.9). The momentum conservation law during the collision is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{p}_{1}+\boldsymbol{p}_{2}=\boldsymbol{p}_{f} \quad \text { where } \quad \boldsymbol{p}_{2}=\mathbf{0} \quad \text { thus } \quad \boldsymbol{p}_{1}=\boldsymbol{p}_{f} \tag{8.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

The kinetic energy variation $\Delta T$ during the collision is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta T=T_{f}-\left(T_{1}+T_{2}\right) \quad \text { where } \quad T_{2}=0 \quad \text { thus } \quad \Delta T=T_{f}-T_{1} \tag{8.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

The momentum conservation law (8.23) can be recast as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
m_{1} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) \boldsymbol{v}_{f} \quad \text { thus } \quad \boldsymbol{v}_{f}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} \boldsymbol{v}_{1} \tag{8.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

The initial kinetic energy $T_{1}$ of the material point 1 and the final kinetic energy $T_{f}$ of the system are given by,

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{1}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{2} \quad \text { and } \quad T_{f}=\frac{1}{2}\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) \boldsymbol{v}_{f}^{2} \tag{8.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking into account equations (8.25) and (8.26), the kinetic energy variation (8.24) is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta T=T_{f}-T_{1}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{m_{1}^{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m_{1} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{2}=-\frac{1}{2} \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{2}<0 \tag{8.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the perfectly inelastic collision is a dissipative process that causes a loss of kinetic energy. This energy is used essentially to deform the object, like a plasticine ball for instance. As an example of perfectly inelastic collision, let us mention the collision between to gliders that remain attached because the spike of one glider sinks into the plasticine stuck on the other (Fig. 2.8).

### 8.2.4 Coefficient of restitution

Elastic collisions and perfectly inelastic collisions are particular cases of a set of possible collisions. The elasticity of a collision against an object of infinite mass can be quantified by the coefficient of restitution defined as the ratio of the norm of the final velocity and the norm of the initial velocity of a body,

$$
\begin{equation*}
e=\frac{v_{f}}{v_{i}} \tag{8.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

There are three types of collisions :

1) elastic : $e=1$
2) inelastic : $0<e<1$
3) perfectly inelastic $: e=0$

As an example, let us mention the inelastic collisions of a tennis ball or a basket ball against the ground (Fig. 8.10). The harder the material is, the smaller will be the deformation during the collision and thus the larger the coefficient of restitution will be.

### 8.3 Two-body problem

Earth-moon system
Two-body systems are very common in mechanics. We can mention the motion of the moon around the earth or the motion of the earth around the sun, the motion of binary stars or even the motion of an electron and a proton in a hydrogen atom. The dynamics of a system consisting of two bodies, that can be considered as material points, in the absence of an external force has symmetry properties that we would like to discover. We start by describing the dynamics of every material point with respect to an arbitrary inertial frame.

### 8.3.1 Reduced law of motion

Let $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$ be the position vector of the material point of mass $m_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{r}_{2}$ the position vector of the material point of mass $m_{2}$ (Fig. 8.11). The laws of motion (2.33) for the material
points are the following :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}=m_{1} \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{1} \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}=m_{2} \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{2} \tag{8.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the interaction forces $\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}$ and $\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}$ are internal forces to the system consisting of the two material points but are considered as external forces to each subsystem consisting of a single material point. These two interaction forces are of arbitrary nature and they satisfy the law of action-reaction (8.1). To determine the position of two material points, the two vectors are needed : $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{r}_{2}$. Since the laws of motion (8.29) are independent of the choice of the origin $O$ of the frame, we can perform a change of variables that defines new position vectors that better account for the symmetries of motion. We define the position vector $\boldsymbol{R}_{G}$ of the centre of mass and the relative position vector $\boldsymbol{r}$ in the following way,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{R}_{G}=\frac{m_{1}}{M} \boldsymbol{r}_{1}+\frac{m_{2}}{M} \boldsymbol{r}_{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{r}=\boldsymbol{r}_{1}-\boldsymbol{r}_{2} \quad \text { where } \quad M=m_{1}+m_{2} \tag{8.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

The centre of mass is the centre of gravity of the system that will be defined explicitly for a system of material points when we will examine the dynamics of rigid bodies. The time derivative of the change of variables implies that,

$$
\begin{equation*}
M \ddot{\boldsymbol{R}}_{G}=m_{1} \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{1}+m_{2} \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}=\ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{1}-\ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{2} \tag{8.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking the sum of the laws of motion (8.29), and using the identities (8.31), we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}+\boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}=m_{1} \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{1}+m_{2} \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{2}=M \ddot{\boldsymbol{R}}_{G} \tag{8.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

According to Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law, we then conclude that,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\ddot{\boldsymbol{R}}_{G}=\mathbf{0} \quad \text { thus } \quad \boldsymbol{V}_{G}=\dot{\boldsymbol{R}}_{G}=\text { const } \tag{8.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

which means that the centre of mass of the system has either a uniform linear motion or it is at rest in the absence of an external force exerted on the system. Taking the difference between the first law of motion (8.29) multiplied by $m_{2}$ and the second multiplied by $m_{1}$, we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
m_{2} \boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}-m_{1} \boldsymbol{F}^{1 \rightarrow 2}=M \mu\left(\ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{1}-\ddot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{2}\right)=M \mu \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}} \tag{8.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the reduced mass is defined as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mu=\frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{M} \quad \text { thus } \quad \frac{1}{\mu}=\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}} \tag{8.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

Dividing equation (8.34) by the total mass $M$, taking into account Newton's $3^{\text {rd }}$ law (8.1), we obtain the reduced law of motion,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{F}^{2 \rightarrow 1}=\mu \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}} \tag{8.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 8.3.2 Momentum and kinetic energy

The total momentum $\boldsymbol{p}$ and the total kinetic energy $T$ of the two material point system are written as,

$$
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{p} & =m_{1} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}+m_{2} \boldsymbol{v}_{2}  \tag{8.37}\\
T & =\frac{1}{2} m_{1} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} \boldsymbol{v}_{2}^{2} \tag{8.38}
\end{align*}
$$

Inverting the change of variables (8.30), taking into account the definition of the reduced mass (8.35), we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{r}_{1}=\boldsymbol{R}_{G}+\frac{\mu}{m_{1}} \boldsymbol{r} \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{r}_{2}=\boldsymbol{R}_{G}-\frac{\mu}{m_{2}} \boldsymbol{r} \tag{8.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

The time derivative of relation (8.39) is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{v}_{1}=\boldsymbol{V}_{G}+\frac{\mu}{m_{1}} \boldsymbol{v} \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{v}_{2}=\boldsymbol{V}_{G}-\frac{\mu}{m_{2}} \boldsymbol{v} \tag{8.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

The substitution of equations (8.40) into the expression (8.37) of the momentum yields,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{p}=M \boldsymbol{V}_{G} \tag{8.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

The substitution of equations (8.40) into the expression (8.38) of the kinetic energy yields,

$$
\begin{align*}
T & =\frac{1}{2} m_{1}\left(\boldsymbol{V}_{G}+\frac{\mu}{m_{1}} \boldsymbol{v}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2}\left(\boldsymbol{V}_{G}-\frac{\mu}{m_{2}} \boldsymbol{v}\right)^{2}  \tag{8.42}\\
& =\frac{1}{2}\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) \boldsymbol{V}_{G}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right) \mu^{2} \boldsymbol{v}^{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Taking into account the definition of the reduced mass (8.35), the expression of the kinetic energy (8.42) reduces to,

$$
\begin{equation*}
T=\frac{1}{2} M \boldsymbol{V}_{G}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} \mu \boldsymbol{v}^{2} \tag{8.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the first term is the constant kinetic energy associated to the motion of the centre of mass and the second term is the kinetic energy associated to the reduced motion.

### 8.3.3 Centre of mass frame of reference

Since the motion of the centre of mass is a uniform linear motion, we can perform a coordinate transformation and define the position vectors $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}^{\prime}$ and $\boldsymbol{r}_{2}^{\prime}$ related to the centre of mass frame of reference. Taking into account the relations (8.39), this coordinate transformation is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{r}_{1}^{\prime}=\boldsymbol{r}_{1}-\boldsymbol{R}_{G}=\frac{\mu}{m_{1}} \boldsymbol{r} \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{r}_{2}^{\prime}=\boldsymbol{r}_{2}-\boldsymbol{R}_{G}=-\frac{\mu}{m_{2}} \boldsymbol{r} \tag{8.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

The time derivative of relations (8.44) is given by,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{\mu}{m_{1}} \boldsymbol{v} \quad \text { and } \quad \boldsymbol{v}_{2}^{\prime}=-\frac{\mu}{m_{2}} \boldsymbol{v} \tag{8.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking into account the expressions (8.44) of the velocities related to the centre of mass frame of reference, the total momentum $\boldsymbol{p}^{\prime}$ related to the centre of mass frame of reference vanishes,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{p}^{\prime}=m_{1} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{\prime}+m_{2} \boldsymbol{v}_{2}^{\prime}=\mathbf{0} \tag{8.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

Taking into account the expressions (8.44) of the velocities related to the centre of mass frame of reference and the expression (8.35) of the reduced mass, the total kinetic energy $T^{\prime}$ related to the centre of mass frame of reference is written as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
T^{\prime}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} \boldsymbol{v}_{1}^{\prime 2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} \boldsymbol{v}_{2}^{\prime 2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right) \mu^{2} \boldsymbol{v}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \mu \boldsymbol{v}^{2} \tag{8.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

Compared to the kinetic energy $T^{\prime}$, the kinetic energy $T$ contains a additional term. This term corresponds to the kinetic energy associated to the motion of the centre of mass of the system.
